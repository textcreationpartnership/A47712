         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Two Ioyntenants, one of them makes a Feoffment in Fee of his Moiety upon condition, and for the breach of the condition re-enters, the Ioynt Eſtate is revived: And he conceived that the Grantee of part of the Eſtate, or part of the Land ſhould not take advantage of the condition; and he ſaid that the Bargainor is an Aſſignee within the Statute: If Tenant in Tail makes a Leaſe for years, and afterwards bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains and ſells the reverſion, the Vendee hath a Fee ſimple de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable, and may enter for the condition broken: If a rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be granted to two, and to the Heirs of one of them, they are Aſſignees within the Statute, and if he, who hath but an eſtate for life, ſurviveth, he alſo is an Aſſignee, for the entire reverſion paſſeth out of the Grantor, and that is my Rule.

Action ſur le Caſe</hi> 36 <hi>Br. Lieu</hi> 84. in the principal Caſe at Bar, the Court was of Opinion, that the Action was well brought in the County of <hi>Norfolk.</hi> Another Exception was taken to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, becauſe the Plaintiff hath there ſet forth whereas his true name is <hi>John Bulwer,</hi> by which name he now ſues, he was ſued and outlawed by the name of <hi>John Buller,</hi> and then
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95367:32"/>
the now Plaintiff upon that matter was never ſued, nor out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawed, and then is not grieved by the Defendant, but <hi>John Buller;</hi> for here in his Declaration there is not any averment that <hi>John Bulwer</hi> and <hi>John Buller</hi> are one and the ſame, and not divers Perſons: But the Exception was diſallowed, for the whole Court held, that for As much as the Plaintiff hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that he, by the name of <hi>John Buller,</hi> was ſued and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawed, the ſame is an averment in Law, &amp;c. and amounts to ſo much. Another matter was objected, becauſe it appeareth in the Declaration that <hi>H. H.</hi> was dead before this Proceſs was ſued, and then the Outlawry was erronious, and ſo the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff is not at any miſchief, but that he may reverſe the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawry by Error; as in Conſpiracy, the Defendant pleads, that the Indictment upon which the Plaintiff is arraigned is viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and erroneous and ſo his life was never in jeopardy. But as to that, it was ſaid by the Court, that the erronious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Defendant ſhall not give advantage to himſelf, but becauſe the Plaintiff was vexed by colour and reaſon of the Outlawry, and put to his Writ of Error, which cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence the loſs and damage by him ſuſtained by reaſon of the Outlawry aforeſaid, it is reaſon that the Plaintiff have his Action; wherefore <hi>Wray</hi> Chief Iuſtice, <hi>ex aſſenſu Sociorum,</hi> gave Iudgment for the Plaintiff.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Man bound himſelf in an Obligation to make an Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Lands the firſt day of <hi>Jan.</hi> and the laſt day of <hi>December,</hi> he to whom the Aſſurance was to be made, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the Obligee, the ſaid laſt day before Sun-ſetting, came to the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor with a Deed ready to be ſealed, and prayed him to ſeal it; who ſaid to him that he was a man unlearned, and ſaid he would ſhew the ſame to his Counſel, and then he would ſeal it. And if the Obligation was forfeited or not, becauſe he did not ſeal it preſently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was the queſtion: And <hi>Fenner</hi> argued that it was not; for when a thing is to be done upon requeſt, then he who makes the requeſt, ought to give ſufficient and convenient time to perform the Condition. I agree, That where the Condition is abſolute, there if the Condition be not performed, he ſhall not be excuſed by the default of another. As if a man be boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to marry <hi>A.S.</hi> and ſhe will not marry him; or to enfeoff <hi>J. S.</hi> and he refuſeth, as 3 <hi>H.</hi> 6. is, the Obligation is forfeited; Yet in theſe Caſes if the Obligee himſelf be the cauſe that <hi>J. S.</hi> will not take the Feoffment, or he will not marry <hi>A. S.</hi> the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not forfeited: So in our Caſe, for by his late requeſt it is impoſſible for me to perform the condition; for before my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel ſhall have peruſed it, the time will be paſt. If a man be bound to enfeoff one of Lands in <hi>Barwick,</hi> requeſt ought to be made ſo long time before, that after that he may go to <hi>Barwick.</hi> So if one be bounden to pay 1000 <hi>l.</hi> to <hi>J.S.</hi> he ought to make his Tender ſo long time before the laſt inſtant of the laſt day, that the mony may conveniently be told. This Caſe was in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. A man made a Feoffment of the Manor of <hi>D.</hi> with the Appurtenances, to which an Advowſon was appendant, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted that the Manor upon requeſt ſhould be diſcharged of all manner of Incumbrances, and before that the Feoffor had granted the next Avoidance to <hi>J. S.</hi> the Incumbent died, the Clark of the Grantee was inſtituted and inducted, the Feoffee requeſted the Feoffor to diſcharge the Incumbrance. The opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of many Sages of the Law was, that he had not made his requeſt within convenient time. So if a man be bounden to infeoff the Obligee to have and to hold to him and his Heirs as long as <hi>J. S.</hi> ſhall have Iſſue of his Body; If the Obligee demand Aſſurance after the death of <hi>J. S.</hi> without Iſſue, yet
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95367:36"/>
the Obligation is not forfeited. In 22 <hi>E.</hi> 4. if Leſſee for the life of another continues poſſeſſion for two or three weeks after the death of <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe,</hi> where he could not have more ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy notice of his death, he ſhall not be a Treſpaſſor. In 15 <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz</hi> it was holden in <hi>Wottons</hi> Caſe, That where he was bound to make a Feoffment to <hi>J. B.</hi> and <hi>J. B.</hi> came to him in <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Hall,</hi> and tendred to him a Writing, and prayed him to ſeal it. And <hi>Wotton</hi> ſaid that he would not, that the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was forfeited; contrary if he had not denyed to ſeal it, but had ſhewed the ſame to his Counſel, as in our Caſe. But the Opinion of the Iuſtices was, that the Obligation was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited. For when he knew the laſt inſtant of the time, he ought to have had his Counſel there ready with him. <hi>Vide</hi> the Caſe of Arbitrement 18 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 21. At another day the Caſe was argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again by <hi>Andrews,</hi> and he ſaid that the Obligation was not forfeited; For he ſaid it is a Rule in Law, <hi>Sic utere tuo, ut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienum non laedas,</hi> and in <hi>E.</hi> 4. a man was bound upon requeſt to relinquiſh and renounce Adminiſtration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there it was holden, that after the requeſt he ought to have convenient time to go to the Ordinary, before it ſhall be ſaid that he had forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Obligation. In 33 <hi>E.</hi> 3. it is ſaid that if <hi>J. S.</hi> be bound, That if <hi>A B</hi> infeoff <hi>C.</hi> that then he ſhall pay to the Obligee 10 <hi>l.</hi> Now if the Feoffment be made after Sun-ſetting as it well may be, yet it is ſufficient to ſave his Obligation, if he pay the mony the next day: And 19 <hi>H.</hi> 6. an Annuity was granted to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant until he was promoted to a Benefice, if a Benefice be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto him before he be of ſufficient age, and he refuſeth it, the Obligation is not forfeited. If a man be bound to enfeoff and make Livery and Seiſin of the Manor of <hi>D</hi> to one upon requeſt, and afterwards the Party is made King, in which Caſe he cannot take Livery, now if upon requeſt the Party refuſeth, yet it is no Forfeiture: And it hath been holden here by you all, That if a man unlearned ſeals a Deed which is written con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the intent of the Parties, the ſame not being read unto him, by that he ſhall not be bound for ever. But the Opinion of the Court was as before, That the Obligation was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited.</p>

Leaſes made for one and twenty years to be good from the day of the date thereof, and one makes a leaſe to begin at a day to come, and by two of the Iuſtices of the <hi>Common Pleas</hi> it is good; but the two other Iuſtices held the contrary. <hi>Clench</hi> Iuſtice, There is no difference, if it be by one Deed or ſeveral Deeds; and therefore he held, that if the Earl had made a leaſe for one and twenty years, and within a year another, it is a void Leaſe, whether it be by one Deed or two Deeds, for he exceeds his Authority: And ſo in the principal Caſe; If there had been no <hi>Proviſo,</hi> he could not have made any leaſe, therefore the <hi>Proviſo</hi> which gave him Authority ought preciſely to be performed. At another day it was argued by <hi>Daniel</hi> for the Leſſee in Reverſion to begin at a day to come, and by him words only are not to be taken or conſidered in a Statute, but the meaning of them, and they are not to be ſevered: Alſo Statute Law is to be expounded by the Common Law, and by the Common Law if one give Authority to another to make leaſes of his Lands, he may make leaſes in Reverſion, becauſe an Authority ſhall be taken moſt beneficially for them for whom it was given. So if one grant an Authority to make Eſtates of his Lands, by that general word, he may make leaſes for years or life, or gifts in tail, Feoffments, or other Eſtates whatſoever. If one gives a Commiſſion to another to make leaſes for One and twenty years of his lands, he may make a leaſe in Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: and that Caſe was in the Duchy between <hi>Alcock</hi> and <hi>Hicks.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Leaſes.</note> 2. It is good by Statute Law: For the Statute of <hi>Richard</hi> 2. which gives Authority to <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe,</hi> to make leaſes, he may thereby make leaſes in Reverſion. The Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. which gives Authority to the chief Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer of the Court of <hi>Surveyors</hi> to make leaſes, if it had ſtayed there he might have made leaſes in Reverſion, but the ſaid Statute goes further, and ſays, <hi>Proviſo</hi> that he ſhall not make a leaſe in Reverſion, <hi>vide</hi> 19 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Dyer</hi> 357. The Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. of leaſes to be made by Husbands of the lands of their Wives by the general words of the ſaid Statute, they might
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95367:38"/>
make Leaſes in Reverſion. But the Statute goes further Proviſo, that there ſhall not be any former Leaſe in being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 21 years before the making of the ſaid Leaſes. In all Caſes of Statutes which are with Proviſoes, the Law up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them ſhall be taken generally, if not in ſuch particulars which are reſtrained by the Proviſo, as here, the Proviſo goes to the ancient Rent to be reſerved, that the Counteſs ſhall have remedy againſt the Leſſees for the ſaid Rent, &amp;c. therefore it is at large in all other points but in theſe: As if the Wife be within age, and ſhe and her Husband joyn in a Leaſe, yet this Leaſe is good by the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Law is general, and doth not reſtrain theſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections expreſly: So a Feoffment in Fee with warranty, Proviſo that he ſhall not Vouch; yet that is a reſtraint as to the Voucher only, and he is at large to Rebutt or have <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantia Chartae:</hi> A Leaſe for life, Proviſo he ſhall not do vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary waſte, he is at large to do other waſte, but otherwiſe it were if there were no Proviſo. Therefore a Proviſo makes the words precedent to be expounded more liberally. The words of the Statute of 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 39. of <hi>Surveyors,</hi> which gives authority to the chief Officer to deviſe, ſet, or let for 21 years, he might have made a Leaſe for 21 years in Reverſion, if the Proviſo had not been. But the words of the Act in our Caſe are <hi>demiſe; demiſes</hi> therefore ſhall be taken moſt liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. 3. As to the intent of the Act, this Leaſe is within it, for the intent is to be collected out of the words, and ſhall not be drawn to any private intent againſt the words which ſhould be done here; for by ſuch Expoſition the Earl, his Heirs, Executors, &amp;c. ſhould be prejudiced, and the Counteſs only ſhould be benefited: Alſo Remedy is given to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs by this Act againſt ſuch Leſſees, that ſhe ſhould have the Rent by Debt or Diſtreſs, as it ſhe had been party or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, therefore it is reaſon <hi>via verſa,</hi> that they have remedy againſt her for their Leaſes: Alſo he ſaid that the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy ſhould be for them as againſt the Earl himſelf if he had lived, therefore they ſhall have remedy againſt her, who might have had it againſt the Earl in his life. Alſo the Statute is to be expounded according to the words, where ſuch Expoſition is not rigorous nor miſchievous. Alſo private Laws are to be expounded by the Letter and ſtrictly, as the Deed of the party, as 14 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Br. Parliament</hi> 16. a particular Act was made that the <hi>Chancellor,</hi> calling to him one of the Iuſtices, might award a <hi>Subpoena</hi> between <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> and end the matter between them; there, by all the Iuſtices but <hi>Littleton,</hi> he ſhall not award a <hi>Subpoena</hi> general, but a <hi>Subpoena</hi> making mention of the Act, for he ſhall purſue the particular Act ſtrictly, and a common Act for the common profit ſhall be conſtrued largely. Alſo a
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95367:39"/>
Statute ſhall not be conſtrued largely by Equity to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of an Eſtate; as the Statute which gives, That if a Woman conſent to a Raviſher, that the next Heir ſhall enter, if the Daughter entreth, and afterward a Son is born, he ſhall not put out the Daughter, becauſe the Statute ſhall not be drawn to a private intent to the overthrow of an Eſtate veſted before lawfully in the Daughter: Therefore neither in our Caſe the Act ſhall not be drawn to a private ſenſe for the benefit of the Counteſs to overthrow the Leaſe for years; and it is not like to the Caſe which hath been put: If he make a Leaſe for twenty years, and for other twenty years, the ſame is not good by the Act, which Caſe I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, for that is a Leaſe for forty years. <hi>Egerton</hi> Solicitor contrary: 1. As to the word <hi>Demiſe</hi> from diſmiſſion, the ſame is nothing elſe but a letting of the Land. Lo Leaſe is from <hi>(Laiſer)</hi> a French word, and ſuch a Demiſe at a day to come is an Intereſt of a Leaſe, and not a Leaſe it ſelf, for he hath not let the Land: As if I ſay, I let you my Land for 21 years: When ſhall you have my Land? Shall you have my Land at a day to come, or preſently? If I fell you Land, and Covenant that it is diſcharged of all other Incumbrances than Leaſes for 21 years, and there is a Leaſe to begin after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for 21 years. I have broken my Covenant. If I am bound to make you a Leaſe for 21 years, and I ſay to you, I make a Leaſe to you to begin 200 years after, I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited my Obligation. If the cuſtom of a Manor be that <hi>Dominus pro tempore</hi> may make Leaſes for 21 years, may he make a Leaſe to begin 20 years after? Truly not, if there be not a Special Cuſtom to make it good. If I give autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to my Steward to make Leaſes of my Lands for 21 years, he cannot make a Leaſe to begin at 100 years hereafter. As to the Caſe of the Duchy, there the Condition is that he ſhall make Leaſes according to his diſcretion, therefore there he may make ſuch Leaſes as he pleaſeth. As to the Statute of <hi>Richard</hi> 2. which enables <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe,</hi> it is not like to our Act or Statute, for that is, that Feoffments, Eſtates, &amp;c. therefore he may make ſuch Leaſes without doubt. If I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe that my Executor ſhall make Leaſes of my Lands for 21 years, he cannot make a Leaſe for to commence 100 years after; and if they do not make them within convenient time, the Heir ſhall avoid their Authority: So the Statute Law hath ſuch Expoſition that the preciſe time ought to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as the Statute of 14 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 18. 1. Receit to Voucher, 8. If the Tenant vouch to warranty a dead man, and the Demandant will aver that the Vouchee is dead, or that there is none ſuch, there the Averment ſhall be received without more delay. Vpon that Statute the Caſe in 21 <hi>E.</hi> 3. where one vouched to warranty, and a <hi>Summoneas ad Warrantizan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:95367:39"/>
iſſued, and then came the Demandant, and would have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verred that the Vouchee is dead, the Tenant ſaid he ought to aver the ſame upon the Voucher to warranty, and that now he had ſurceaſed his time to take advantage of the time; and the Demandant ſaid, That the Statute did not bind him to that, nor preſcribed any time, but left the ſame generally, yet by the Court it was awarded that he ſhould have the Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the time of the Voucher, or not at all. So the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>cap</hi> 20. If a woman who hath a Ioynture for life or in Tail, and ſuffers a Common Recovery, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Statute of 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 20. and afterwards the Iſſue in Tail, releaſeth all his right by Fine and dieth, his Iſſue may enter, for the aſſent ought to be by Voucher in the ſame Action, and the like, for if there be a mean inſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Recovery and the Aſſent, then any Aſſent after is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe; for the Recovery being once void by the Statute, it cannot be made good by aſſent afterwards, <hi>Vide Dr. &amp; Student</hi> 54. and yet the Statute ſaith, Provided that the Act ſhall not extend to any ſuch Recovery, Diſcontinuance, &amp;c. if the next heir be aſſenting to the ſame Recovery, &amp;c. ſo as the ſame Aſſent or Agreement is of Record or enrolled; and doth not ſay, If the Aſſent ought to be at one time, or at another. But to come to Leaſes upon Statutes. Before the Statute of 2 <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. if Leaſes were not found by Offices, they ſhould be ouſted and put to their Traverſe. But put caſe that after that Statute a Leaſe to begin at a day to come is not found by Office, ſhall it be aided by that Statute? No truly, and ſo it is holden in the Court of Wards at this day. And the Lord Chief Iuſtice of <hi>England</hi> ſo held in his Reading at <hi>Lincolns Inn:</hi> The Statute of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> of Leaſes to be made by Biſhops is, that Leaſes other then for 21 years from the time that they begin, that is, when they take effect as a Deed, and when they take effect not to be executed; for ſo they might make infinite Leaſes: <hi>Quaere</hi> the further part of <hi>Egertons</hi> Argument in this Caſe; And <hi>vide</hi> in <hi>Cooks</hi> 1 part of his Reports, where this Caſe is reported to be adjudged; that the Leaſe made in Reverſion by the Earl was a void Leaſe.</p>

                  <hi>(Pro)</hi> doth not make a condition, as if before the Statute of <hi>Quia emptores terrarum,</hi> one makes a Feoffment of lands <hi>pro ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magio ſuo,</hi> there if the homage be not done, he may diſtrain for it. 9 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 21.

In 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> there was a Caſe of one <hi>Etherel,</hi> where the Biſhop of <hi>York</hi> made a leaſe for years re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving rent to him and his Succeſſors, <hi>Proviſo</hi> that during the time of every vacation, the rent ſhould be paid to the <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> and it was not paid to them after the death of the Biſhop, during the vacation: It was holden to be no condition, but a limitation. Alſo if the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo</hi> here ſhall be a condition, then it is a favourable leaſe accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the will, for a conditional leaſe is not a favourable leaſe. 2. Point. If it be a Condition; yet the Plaintiff ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the rent for which the demand ſhall be, where the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is only the moiety of an annual rent, and he demands the whole, therefore his demand is not good; for if a Feoffment be pleaded made by one, and the Deed is ſhewed, by which it appeareth that it was made by many, although he was one of them, yet it is not good, nor warranted by it. Alſo the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion which they make doth deſtroy the whole, for it is, <hi>Et quia praedict. redditus</hi> was not payed, &amp;c. Which was that? the rent of the whole year, <hi>ſcil.</hi> 11 <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> and that is falſe; for if the moiety was paid, he had no cauſe to enter; but by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, if all was paid but a penny, yet they might enter, and therefore the Rejoynder is not good. <hi>Cook</hi> contrary, for the Avowant: he ſaid, It is a condition, and he put this as a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:95367:41"/>
Rule, That where a <hi>Proviſo</hi> is parcel of the ſentence which contains Covenant, or abridgeth parcel of the Covenant, that it doth not make a Condition, but an Exception. As <hi>Litt.</hi> a rent granted, <hi>Proviſo</hi> that he ſhall not charge his perſon, the ſame is not a Condition, becauſe it abridgeth parcel of the Grant, and controuls the Sentence precedent. So 9 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo</hi> that he ſhall not do voluntary Waſte, for it abridgeth the firſt impeachment of Waſte. So a Feoffment with warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Proviſo</hi> that he ſhall not vouch, abridgeth parcel of the force of the warranty; for by warranty he may rebut, vouch, or have <hi>Warrantia Chartae:</hi> Therefore there where it is parcel of the Sentence which contains Covenant, it is not a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and that difference was holden and agreed in the Lord <hi>Mountjoyes</hi> Caſe. But in our Caſe there is not a qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sentence, or Covenant contained in the Sentence, nor participant at all with the Sentence, but it ſtands <hi>ſubſtantivè,</hi> for there was a full Sentence before, and therefore it is not parcel of it. Alſo it varies from the Sentence precedent in the perſon who ſhall pay the rent, and to whom it ſhall be paid, and therefore it is a new Sentence, and ſtrange to the firſt: and it is not like to the Caſe of 9 <hi>H.</hi> 6. before, <hi>Br. Warranty,</hi> he ſhall not vouch, for there it controuls the precedent Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: But if I make a Feoffment in Fee with warranty, that he ſhall not vouch <hi>J. S.</hi> who is a ſtranger, there it is a Condition; but if it is that he ſhall not vouch the Feoffor, there it is not a Condition. And the Caſe of the Biſhop of <hi>York,</hi> was <hi>Paſc.</hi> 4 <hi>Eliz. Rot.</hi> 460. <hi>Com. Banc.</hi> he conceived, that during the vacation, the rent ſhould go to the King, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perhaps he eſpecially limited it to be paid to the <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> and there the <hi>Proviſo</hi> did not make a Condition: For although it was limited to be paid to the <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapter</hi> in the time of the vacation, with a <hi>Proviſo,</hi> or by way of Promiſe, yet there it is a Condition, for all is one Corporation; for the <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapter</hi> are part of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration to whom it was reſerved before for it was reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before to the Biſhop and his Succeſſors.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:95367:41"/>
alſo the Opinion of <hi>Br.</hi> 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. is controuled; that where a <hi>Proviſo</hi> is jumbled amongſt Covenants, that it doth not make a Condition: <hi>Proviſo</hi> never makes a Covenant, therefore, either the Sentence ſhall be void, or it ſhall be a Condition. As if a Leaſe for years be made, <hi>Proviſo</hi> that the Leſſee for years do not commit Waſte, it is no covenant.

               <p>IN an <hi>Ejectione firmae</hi> upon a Special Verdict, the Caſe was this, King <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. granted the Manor and Hundred of <hi>Treming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> in Fee, rendring rent, to hold of the Manor of <hi>Eaſt Greenwich</hi> in Socage, <hi>reddendo annuatim</hi> 136 <hi>l.</hi> Queen <hi>Mary</hi> reciting the firſt Grant; in the firſt year of her reign, granted the rent and feal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and the Manors of <hi>Cauford, D. S. Et etiam Manerium noſtrum, &amp; Hundredum de Tremington</hi> (although ſhe had not the Manor) to the Marqueſs of <hi>Exceter;</hi> after which the Marchioneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeized of the Manor of <hi>Cauford</hi> holden in <hi>Capite,</hi> and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lands 4 and 5 <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> deviſed the Manor of <hi>Cauford, D. S.</hi> and whereas ſhe had nothing in the Manor of <hi>Tremington,</hi> but the rent and fealty out of it; ſhe deviſed the ſame with the others to the Lord <hi>Mountjoy:</hi> and alſo ſhe deviſed divers Legacies and Annuities to her Servants and others. And deviſed by the ſame Will, that they ſhould be levied of the Manor of <hi>Tremington,</hi> and of the Manors of <hi>D. S.</hi> whereas <hi>D. S.</hi> were not Manors but Farms. And one <hi>Barker</hi> was found Heir to the Deviſor, who claimed to have the third part: The firſt queſtion was. If the rent and fealty here holden in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite,</hi> paſſed by the name of the Manor, or not; and if they paſſed, what quantity paſſed. <hi>Walmſley,</hi> They do not paſs by that name; for this rent, <hi>nec in rei veritate, nec in reputatione,</hi> was ever taken for a Manor. Alſo ſhe hath named it in her Will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe which are very Manors, by which it appeareth, that her intent was not to paſs it, unleſs it was a Manor, as the other, which ſenſe is alſo fortified that they ſhall be levied, parcelled, and taken; by which I conceive her meaning was, that there ſhould be ſome place to which the Deviſees might reſort to levy it. Further, It is taken for Law in Wills; that a thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed ſhall not deſtroy a thing expreſſed: But if by implication,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:95367:42"/>
the Rent ſhould paſs, then the Manor of <hi>Cauford</hi> ſhould not paſs, which was her expreſs will to paſs. As 16 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 330. where a man deviſeth his Lands to one and his Heirs Males, and if he dye without Heir of his Body, &amp;c. Here he ſhall not have Tail general to the Heirs of his Body, but to the Heirs males of his body, for that was the expreſs limitation, and the other after but implication. So 16 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 333. in <hi>Chapmans</hi> Caſe: But our Caſe is better, for that there are not words ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to warrant any implication, for <hi>nec in veritate,</hi> nor in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſpeech was it ever taken for a Manor. 27 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 2. 22 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 39. <hi>Green Acre</hi> may paſs by the name of a Manor, although it be but an Acre of Land, becauſe it is known by ſuch name. In 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. a man having ſuffered a common Recovery to his uſe, willed that his Feoffees ſhould ſell, &amp;c. So in <hi>Chapmans</hi> Caſe, a man in his Will limited a Remainder to his Family, there it is taken, the ſame is a Remainder to thoſe which are his next of Blood. So 41 <hi>E.</hi> 3. a man deviſeth Land to <hi>A.</hi> his Daughter, in truth ſhe being a Baſtard, ſhe ſhall have it, becauſe ſhe is known by the name of Daughter. So if there be Grandfather, Father and Son, the Father dyeth and the Son gives Lands to his Father and his Heirs, the Grandfather ſhall have it, for that the Son ſo called him. 19 <hi>H.</hi> 8. Lands are deviſed to the right Heirs of <hi>J. S.</hi> who is attainted, having Iſſue a Son, the Son ſhall not have the Land, for the word <hi>(Heir)</hi> intends one who may inherit, but he cannot, becauſe a man attainted cannot have an Heir: And that is a ſtronger Caſe than our Caſe, in which there is not any affinity with a Manor, for it is but a ſum in groſs, but if it had been an Acre of Land, peradventure it ſhould have paſſed, but being Rent, Common, Eſtovers, or other Profits, they cannot paſs, for they have not any reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to the Mannor; but peradventure a man having a Manor parcel in Demeſn, and parcel in Services if he alieneth his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſns, and afterwards deviſeth his Manor, the Services will paſs. <hi>Gawdy,</hi> All the difficulty of the Caſe is this, If by the Deviſe, the rent out of <hi>Tremington</hi> ſhall paſs, for if not, then the third part thereof cometh to <hi>Barker.</hi> And I conceive clearly, That the rent ſhall paſs; for Wills ſhall have a favourable conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion according to the intent of the Deviſor, and no part thereof ſhall be void, if by any means it may be made good; for intent then appeareth, that ſomething ſhould paſs out of the Manor of <hi>Tremington,</hi> for otherwiſe a Clauſe in her Will would be frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. For it is preciſely found by the Iury, that neither at the time of the Will, nor at the time of her death, ſhe had nothing of the ſaid Manor of <hi>Tremington,</hi> but the ſaid Rent of one hundred thirty and ſix pounds. Alſo it may be taken that ſhe who deviſed was ignorant of the Law, and conceived that it was a Manor when ſhe had Rents and Services out thereof, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, thoſe who are learned in the Law know, that a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:95367:42"/>
could not paſs without there was two Suitors at the leaſt, 21 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>Deviſe</hi> 27. Lands are deviſed to one for life, the remainder <hi>Eccleſiae Sancti Andreae</hi> in <hi>Holborn,</hi> there it is hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in an <hi>Ex gravi Querela,</hi> that the Parſon ſhould recover, for otherwiſe the Deviſe ſhould be void, if the Parſon ſhould not have the Lands; and in Wills, ſhall ſubſerve and give place to the intent of the Party; and therefore if a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeth, that his Lands ſhall be ſold for the payment of his debts, his Executors ſhall ſell them, and to that intent the naming of them Executors is ſufficient. <hi>Plow. Com.</hi> 523. in <hi>Weldens</hi> Caſe it is vouched to be adjudged; that if one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. deviſeth that his Feoffees ſhall be ſeized to the uſe of <hi>A.</hi> in Fee, that it was a good Deviſe of the Lands to <hi>A.</hi> and yet then he had not, nor could have any Feoffees, &amp;c. But the Party was ignorant of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, and his intent to paſs the Land was apparent, in that Caſe the words were as much impertinent to the matter, as in our Caſe, for there he had not any Feoffees, as here ſhe hath not any Manor. <hi>Br.</hi> recites, That in 38 <hi>H.</hi> 8. it was holden by <hi>Baldwin, Shelly,</hi> and <hi>Morgan,</hi> that if a man who had Feoffees to his uſe would, after the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. that his Feoffees ſhould make an Eſtate to <hi>J. S.</hi> that the Land ſhould paſs to <hi>J. S.</hi> 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Feoffments &amp; Faits</hi> 12. Land cannot paſs by the Deed of an Houſe, for it cannot be parcel of an Houſe; but an Acre of Land may be given by the name of a Carve, and a Carve of Land by the name of a Manor; and yet a Carve can be no more a Manor, than this rent: yea, Rents and Services more reſemble a Manor, than a Carve of Land. It cannot be intended that her Will was here to paſs the Manor it ſelf, which was not in her, but in another. Alſo ſhe by four years before had the rent, and therefore it ſhall be intended, that it was her meaning to paſs the ſame, which ſhe her ſelf received, and no other thing: and although in the Deviſe the rent be ſpecially named, and the Manor alſo yet the ſame ſhall not alter the Caſe; for if a man grant the Reverſion upon an Eſtate for life, and by the ſaid Deed grants the Land, and the Tenant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torns, and the Grantee deviſeth all his Land, the Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhall paſs without all queſtion. If a man grant the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowſon of <hi>D.</hi> and in the ſame Deed, the Church and Recto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>D.</hi> and the Grantee deviſeth the Rectory of <hi>D.</hi> the Advowſon ſhall paſs. In <hi>Adams</hi> Caſe, <hi>Plow. Com.</hi> 195. a man leaſeth his Capital Meſſuage rendring rent, there the queſtion is, If the Reverſion or Rent ſhall paſs: It was adjudged, That all which he had paſſed. As to that, that it cannot be levied out of the Rent, for that no place is therein of Diſtreſs; I ſay, that ſhe did not know whether a leſſer rent might be paid out of a greater rent, and 1 <hi>H</hi> 4. Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95367:43"/>
was granted reſerving rent, and the Grant was good. The words of the Will are, <hi>All which Manors, Lands, and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements, &amp;c.</hi> ſhe deviſed to the Lord <hi>Mountjoy,</hi> and theſe words expound her meaning, for although the word <hi>(Rent)</hi> be not within the word <hi>(Manor)</hi> yet the words <hi>(Lands and Tenements)</hi> do comprehend it, and words ſubſequent in Wills may expreſs the Premiſſes. As 16 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 333. <hi>Chapman</hi> ſeized in Fee of two Houſes, having three Brothers, deviſed the Houſe in which <hi>A.</hi> inhabited to his three Brethren, and <hi>A.</hi> to dwell there, and they not to raiſe the rent, and deviſed the Houſe in which <hi>B.</hi> his Brother dwelt to him, and that he pay to <hi>C.</hi> his Brother 3 <hi>l.</hi> for to find him at School, and otherwiſe to remain to the Houſe; <hi>Proviſo</hi> that the Houſes ſhall not be ſold, but ſhall go to the next of the Name and Blood which are Male, and dyed. <hi>B.</hi> his brother dyed without Iſſue, the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the two middle brothers entred, and had Iſſue a Son and dyed. It was a Queſtion, If the Son or the middle bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould have the Houſe: And it was holden that the Son of the eldeſt ſhould have it in Tail, which Expoſition was by reaſon of the words in the <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that it ſhould not be Sold, and that it ſhould go to the Heirs Males. <hi>Shuttleworth,</hi> The rent ſhall not paſs by the Deviſe, for the conſtruction of a Will ought to be according to the words, or according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent collected out of the words, and not by a thing out of the Will; for then a ſtranger ſhall be the maker of the Will of another: And 19 <hi>H.</hi> 8. if a Will be doubtful it ought to be expounded for the Heir at the Common Law. And if the rent ought to paſs, it ought to have apt words, and not the name of a Manor. And thereupon he put the Caſe, that where one deviſeth certain Lands to one, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Goods, Leaſes, and other things to another: All his Goods and Terms ſhall paſs, but not his Lands, for that there wanteth apt words to paſs them, for the word <hi>(other things)</hi> ſhall not paſs them, and this ſet order ought to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, for the avoiding of confuſion: And the Rent and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices ſhall not paſs for the two parts, admitting the words ſufficient, for they cannot be divided: But <hi>Periam</hi> ſaid, That the rent might be divided. <hi>Anderſon</hi> ſaid, That it ſhould be but a Rent-ſeck: <hi>Periam</hi> ſaid it was a Rent diſtrainable of Common Right, but <hi>Anderſon</hi> doubted of it; but they all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed that it might be divided, but there ſhould not be two Tenures. <hi>Fenner,</hi> The Rent ſhould paſs by the Deviſe of the Manor, for there is do difference betwixt a Manor and a Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niory in groſs amongſt Lay-men; and then their intent ſhall be taken, although it was not written by apt words; for in Grants a Reverſion ſhall be taken for a Remainder, and <hi>à For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiori</hi> a Deviſe. And 7 <hi>E.</hi> 3. a Manor ſhall paſs by the name of a Knights Fee; and 19 <hi>H.</hi> 8. a Wood ſhall paſs by the name
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:95367:43"/>
of Land, and 38 <hi>E.</hi> 3. by grant of <hi>totam terram</hi> which <hi>A.</hi> held in dower, the Reverſion ſhall paſs. Afterwards in <hi>Mich.</hi> Term the Plaintiff diſcontinued his Ation. And <hi>Periam</hi> told me, I being at his Houſe, that the Opinion of the Court was againſt the Plaintiff, and if it had not been diſcontinued, they would have given Iudgment accordingly: Now this was the intent of the Lord <hi>Mountjoy.</hi> The Marchioneſs had deviſed all her Lands, and had not left any thing to her Heir, for which Caſe the Heir of the Marchioneſs entred into the third part of the Manor of <hi>Cauford</hi> (of which the Leaſe upon which the <hi>Ejectione firmae</hi> was brought, was made by the Lord <hi>Mountjoy</hi> to <hi>Inſley</hi>) and into the third part of the reſidue of the whole land, now his meaning was, That if the rent was not well paſſed by the name of the Manor, then the ſame deſcended to the Heir, which was ſufficient for him: For the Special Verdict found alſo, That the rent was the third part of the value of the whole Land of the Marqueſs: So that thereupon it may be collected, That if a man hath three Manors, ſome of them holden <hi>in Capite,</hi> and of equal value, and he deviſeth two of them, and ſuffereth the third to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend, that the Deviſe is good for every part of the two Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, and the Heir ſhall not have the third part of each Manor.</p>

This Caſe was this Term argued by <hi>Walmeſly</hi> Serjeant, that an Eſtate tail cannot ceaſe, for it is an Eſtate of Inheritance; and here is not any limitation, for the Eſtate tail by the meaning of the Devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor ſhall remain revivable upon the death of the Offender, but a Limitation determines the Eſtate utterly, which is not here: but here it appeareth as well by the meaning of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſor, as by the words of the Deviſe, that the Eſtate tail upon ſuch act ſhould be ſuſpended, and it cannot be reſembled to the Caſe cited on the other ſide 22 <hi>E.</hi> 3.

From ſuch Caſes the Law reſpects the nature of the Seiſin and the manner of the poſſeſſion. And as to the Caſe vouched out of <hi>Dyer</hi> 12 <hi>Eliz.</hi> where the Husband and Wife were ſeized of a Meſſuage to them, and to the Heirs of the Husband, they ſuffer a common Recovery, and the Husband alone decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the uſes, the ſame is good, for in that Caſe the Fee was in the Husband, and always he who hath the Fee ought and may declare the uſe, if all who have intereſt will not joyn, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if Lands be given to two, and to the Heirs of one of them, if they both joyn in a Fine he which hath the Fee may by himſelf declare the uſes: But if there be two Ioyntenants in Fee, they both ought to joyn in the Declaration of the uſes, or otherwiſe make ſeveral Declarations of their ſeveral Moieties. So if <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuy que uſe</hi> and his Feoffees joyn in a Fine, and make ſeveral Declarations, the Declaration of the Feoffees ſhall ſtand, for that the Land paſſeth from them.

The Queen purchaſeth Lands in Borough Engliſh hath Iſſue a Son, and dyeth ſeized he hath the Land now by deſcent; afterwards a younger Son is born, that Land ſhall be diveſted out of the poſſeſſion of the King, and the Royalty of his perſon doth not alter the right of deſcent: And afterwards, foraſmuch as the ſame deprivation is the act of the Incumbent, the refuſal the act of the Ordinary himſelf, the ſentence and not the act of God in the caſe before cited.

               <p>AN Abbot made a Leaſe to three men for eighty years, and in the end of the ſaid Leaſe there was a clauſe, <hi>Proviſo,</hi> That if they dyed within the ſaid Term, that then the Leſſor might enter.

               <p>DEbt by <hi>Euſtace Kightley</hi> againſt <hi>Charles Kightley</hi> Executors of the laſt Will of <hi>Francis Kightley:</hi> The Defendant pleaded that they had fully adminiſtred. The Caſe was this, <hi>Francis Kightley</hi> made the Defendants his Executors, who being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in age adminiſtration was committed to another until they came of full age, and after they were of full age, the Iury found, that in the hands of the Adminiſtrator, <hi>fuerunt bona &amp; debita Teſtato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> amounting to the value of 4000 <hi>l.</hi> To which Adminiſtrator the Executors did releaſe at their full age all manner of demands; and if that releaſe were Aſſets in the hands of the Executors was the Queſtion. <hi>Puckering</hi> Serjeant argued, it was not Aſſets, for a Releaſe of a thing, which is not Aſſets in the hands of an Executor, cannot be Aſſets, and things in Action, before they come in poſſeſſion, cannot be Aſſets: But a gift of Goods in poſſeſſion is Aſſets. And there is a difference betwixt a certain thing releaſed, and a thing incertain, of a certain it is Aſſets, for by ſuch means he hath given a thing which is Aſſets, but contrary of an incertain. And this difference is proved by
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:95367:56"/>
13 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Execut.</hi> 91. where it is holden, that if Executors releaſe to the debtor, he ſhall account for ſuch ſum before the <hi>Ordinary</hi> by <hi>Parn,</hi> but <hi>Trew</hi> ſaid he ſhall not account. The whole Court was againſt <hi>Puckering:</hi> And <hi>Anderſon</hi> ſaid, It is a clear Caſe, that this Releaſe is Aſſets, for he hath thereby given away that which might have been Aſſets. And the Law doth intend, that when he releaſes he hath recompence and ſatisfaction from the Party to whom the releaſe is made: And it is not requiſite, that every Aſſets be a thing in Poſſeſſion, or in the hands of the Teſtator, for a thing may be Aſſets which never was in the hands of a Teſtator, as monies for Lands or other Goods ſold. So if they come by reaſon of another thing, which was in the Teſtators hands; as the encreaſe of Goods by the Executors in their hands by merchandizing with the Goods of the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor or Goods purchaſed by the Villein of the Teſtator after his death, ſhall be Aſſets. So monies received by the Executor of the Bailiff of the Teſtator after his death ſhall be ſaid Aſſets. <hi>Windam</hi> Iuſtice, So it is if the Teſtator hath Sheep, Corn, or Swine, and dyeth, and they have young Lambs, Pigs, or Calves, they are Aſſets for the reaſon aforeſaid: And he agreed that the releaſe is Aſſets, and he ſaid it had been ſo adjudged, and he denied the difference taken by <hi>Puckering. Periam</hi> agreed with the reſt in all; and alſo denied the difference. And he ſaid, the incertainty muſt be ſuch, that the ſame cannot be proved to the Court, or unto a Iury; that the thing releaſed might not by poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility have been Aſſets. For if Treſpaſs be done to the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor by taking his Goods, and he dyeth, and the Executors releaſe all Actions, the ſame is Aſſets, becauſe it might be proved to the Iury, that had they not releaſed, but brought their Action of Treſpaſs <hi>de bonis aſportatis in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

With whom <hi>Rhodes</hi> agreed. And <hi>Periam</hi> conceived that ſuch Adminiſtrators made <hi>durante minori aetate</hi> of the Executor, could not by our Law neither ſue or be ſued: For as he conceived, the Infant was the Executor and an Infant Executor may either ſue or be ſued, and may releaſe if there be a ſufficient conſideration given him where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaid if an Adminiſtrator doth releaſe where he hath no cauſe nor good conſideration, he ſhall be anſwerable of his own Goods when he cometh of full age, for the waſting of the Eſtate, and ſuch a releaſe ſhall be Aſſets: and it was holden, that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe before <hi>Probate</hi> of the Will is good, and it is Aſſets alſo. And the ſame Term Iudgment was given, that the Releaſe of the Executor was Aſſets.</p>

The King granted to the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> that he ſhould have <hi>Catalla Felonum &amp; Fugitivorum de omnibus hominibus, &amp; tenent. de &amp; in terris &amp; feodis praedict. &amp; de omnibus reſidentibus infra terr. &amp; feoda praedict. ita quod ſi prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicti homines, tenentes &amp; reſident. de &amp; in terris &amp; feodis prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict. ſeu aliqui eorundem, ſeu aliquis alius infra eadem terras &amp; feo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da pro aliqua tranſgreſſione ſua, ſeu quocunque alio delicto vitam, vel membrum debeat, vel fugerit &amp; judicio ſtare noluerit, ſeu ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam aliam tranſgreſſionem fecerit pro qua ipſe Catalla ſua perdere debeat, in quocunque loco juſtitia de ea fieri debeat. Ipſa Catalla ſint ipſius Epiſc. &amp; per Miniſtros Epiſc. fn manus ipſius Epiſc. ſeſiri poſſint. Tirwhit,</hi> The Goods of thoſe that are put to penance do not paſs, ſo the Goods of a <hi>Felo de ſe, Vide</hi> 42 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 5. where one being impanelled upon the Grand Inqueſt before the Iuſtices of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> pleaded the Kings Charter of Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Inqueſts; and becauſe in the ſaid Charter there was not this Clauſe <hi>(Licet tangit nos &amp; haeredes noſtros)</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out challenge it was rejected, and he charged, and ſworn. And if the King grant to me to appropriate an Advowſon, which in truth is holden of the King, ſuch a Grant is void. So if there be not ſpecial words, by which it may appear that the King
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:95367:59"/>
hath notice of it, and that his intent was, that the Grant ſhould extend to the ſame, it doth not paſs, 16 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Fitz. Grants</hi> 58 and 33 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Grants</hi> 103 So here this Preſentment is a ſpecial Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel; and it is not uſually intended, or thought upon when a man ſpeaks generally of Goods and Chattels, but that it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, yet the Preſentment doth not lye for the Defendants, for they do not derive any intereſt under that Grant, but are meer ſtrangers to it, and therefore they ſhall not take any advantage in laying this Grant in the Queens way; for the Queen hath good title againſt all perſons, but thoſe which claim under the ſaid Grant, but that is nothing to the Defendants. For one cannot croſs the title of the King, if he doth not make a title to himſelf. As 39 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 18. 17 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 11. if the title of the King be found by a falſe Office, the party grieved cannot traverſe the title of the King, without making a title to himſelf, and then the King may chooſe whether he will maintain his own title found by the Office, or traverſe the title of the other. <hi>Walmeſley</hi> to the contrary this title of Preſentment is a Chattel, <hi>Rex habebit omnia Catalla felonum, &amp;c. Terminus Annorum</hi> is a Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, ſo <hi>Exitus &amp; proficua terrarum utlagatorum pro felonia;</hi> ſo a right of Action for Goods; ſo it is of an Obligation made to the party delinquent, therefore alſo a title to preſent; therefore if a title to preſent ſhall accrue to the King by ſuch general words, it ſhall paſs alſo from the King by ſuch words; and as to that which hath been objected, That the Grant of King <hi>E.</hi> 4. extends only to ſuch Goods and Chattels which may be ſeized. He cited the Caſe 39 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 35. where the Grantee of a Rent-charge, for a term of years granted <hi>Omnia Bona &amp; Catal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la ſua tam viva, quam mortua,</hi> the Rent paſſed, and yet the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee could not put him in Seiſin of it when he would, but ought to expect the day of payment. And this title to preſent is not a thing in action, for if no diſturbance be made, the Party may have the benefit of it without any Action. <hi>Anderſon</hi> held that this title to preſent could not paſs by theſe general words, <hi>Bona &amp; Catalla,</hi> for they do not extend to a Right, or things in Action, but to ſuch things only which are commonly known and underſtood by ſuch words. By grant of Goods, Chattels real do not paſs. For when men ſpeak of Goods, Houſhold-ſtuff, Mony, and the like, perſonal things only are underſtood. So a man cannot be ſaid to have a Chattel but where he is poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of it, and here this Intereſt is but <hi>Jus praeſentandi. Periam,</hi> This Intereſt is a Chattel; for if the Church became void and before Preſentment the Patron dyeth, his Executors ſhall have the Preſentment, for that it was a Chattel veſted in their Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator, &amp;c.</p>

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:95367:63"/>
                  <hi>Park</hi> within the ſaid Manor ſhould not paſs. But perhaps if ſuch a Leaſe had been <hi>Omnes &amp; ſingulas terras dominicales quaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque,</hi> the <hi>Park</hi> would have paſſed. And afterwards the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the Plaintiff ſeeing that the Court was of Opinion with the Defendant, took Exception to the pleading: The Defendant made <hi>Conuſans ut Ballivus Adminiſtratoris</hi> of the Grantee of the Rent, and doth not ſhew the Letters of Adminiſtration. And as to that, It was agreed by the Court that that had been a good Exception if the matter had not been relieved by the Statute of 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> of Demurrers. Another matter was objected upon the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 37. upon the words of the ſaid Statute, ſo long as the Lands remain in the poſſeſſion of the Tenant in Demeaſn, who ought immediately to have paid the ſaid Rent. And it was ſaid by <hi>Anderſon</hi> and <hi>Rhodes,</hi> that the Conuſans was good enough, and within the relief of that Statute: For <hi>Lewk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> was the immediate Purchaſer, and although he had let the Lands to another at will, that did not make any thing, for yet the Eſtate of the Land is within the words of the Statute, for the Land remains in the Seiſin of the firſt Purchaſer. And note that in this caſe <hi>Bouchier</hi> dyed before the Leaſe expired, ſo as the Rent was not determined in his life. And afterwards Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was given for the Defendant.</p>

               <p>IN the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> it was found by Special Verdict,<note place="margin">1 Leon. 4.</note> That the <hi>Guardian</hi> and <hi>Chanons Regular</hi> of <hi>Otlery</hi> were ſeized of the Manor of <hi>O, &amp;c.</hi> and that 22 <hi>H.</hi> 7. at a Court holden, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lands in queſtion to <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>W.</hi> his Son, for their lives, by Copy, according to the Cuſtom of the ſaid Manor, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards 30 <hi>H.</hi> 8. they leaſed the ſame Land by Indenture to <hi>H.</hi> rendring the ancient and accuſtomed rent, and afterwards ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred their Colledge, &amp;c. and afterwards <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>W.</hi> dyed.

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:95367:67"/>
his remainder in tail was the queſtion, or if it be a forfeiture. <hi>Altham</hi> argued that here is a forfeiture: 1. It is to ſee if a common recovery ſuffered by Tenant for life (which here is the Bargainee) be a forfeiture or no by the common Law,<note place="margin">1 Leon. 264. its not forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. 2 Leon. 60, 65.</note> if no Execution be ſued upon the ſame Recovery. 2. If it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, then, if he in the remainder may enter for the forfeiture. When the Tenant for life bargains and ſells the Meſſuage, although upon it an eſtate in fee be limited, yet nothing paſſeth from him, but what he may lawfully paſs, and that was the eſtate for life of the Bargainor, for ſuch an eſtate only he might lawfully paſs; and here the Vendee is but Tenant for the life of another, and when of his own aſſent he ſuffers a common recovery, and that without right, it is a forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: By matter in Fait a particular Tenant may commit a forfeiture, as well as by matter of Record: By matter in Fait he cannot commit a forfeiture, if not thereby the rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be not pulled out of him in the reverſion: As if a Leſſee for 10 years make a Leaſe for 1000 years, it is not a forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for by that the reverſion is not touched; but if he by matter of Record do any thing which ſounds to the diſinheriting of him in the reverſion, although in truth the ſame doth not touch the Inheritance, yet it is a forfeiture, <hi>Vid.</hi> 39 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 16.

In <hi>Scire facias</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute a Fine againſt Tenant for life, who pleaded to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt whereas in truth the Land in demand was not compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed within the Fine, Iudgment is given for the Demandant
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:95367:67"/>
in the <hi>Scire facias,</hi> he in the reverſion may enter: In our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal caſe, here is apparent and manifeſt Covin; for the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for life voucheth without cauſe, and this Recovery is by aſſent, and is to the uſe of the Vendee, who is Tenant for the life of another, and therefore, by the Common Law, he in the Remainder may enter before Execution ſued: And it is well known that theſe common Recoveries are uſed for to dock Remainders in Tail, and that was the ſcope of this Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

Title Forfeiture</hi> 87. 24 <hi>H.</hi> 8. Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for life is impleaded, and prays in the Aid of a ſtranger, he in the Reverſion may enter; but if he doth not enter until the other hath recovered, then he cannot enter, but is put to his Writ of Entry, <hi>Ad terminum qui praeteriit, vel de ingreſſu ad Communem Legem,</hi> and therein he ſhall falſifie the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; and there, by <hi>Brook,</hi> Voucher of a ſtranger is not cauſe of Forfeiture, for it doth not diſaffirm the Reverſion in the Leſſor: And he vouched 24 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 68. where Tenant for life pleaded in the right with aid prayer: And ſo he argued, that before Execution he in the Remainder might enter but after Execution is put to his Action: But in our Caſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that Execution be good, yet he in the Remainder may enter, for it is found by Verdict, that at the time of the Recovery he was within age, and that when he dyed, that he in the next Remainder was within age, and then no Entry ſhall be imputed, and then he ſhall not be driven to his Action: As if Tenant by the Courteſie makes a Feoffment with war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty, and dyeth; and the ſame deſcends to his Heir within age, yet he ſhall enter, although he hath not avoided the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty in the life of his Anceſtors: Alſo he ſaid that the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. extended to this Caſe; for Sir <hi>William Pelham</hi> the Vendee was but Tenant for life, and although that he be but Tenant for the life of another, yet he is Tenant for life as fully as if he were Tenant for his own life, (or otherwiſe Tenant for life or lives.) Note this, the words of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute. As upon the Statute of 20 <hi>E.</hi> 1. which gives Reſceipt, <hi>de defenſione juris,</hi> the words are, <hi>Cum quis aliquod breve Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini Regis impetret verſus Tenentem per Legem Angliae, vel feod taliat' vel ſub Nomine Dotis, vel alio modo, ad terminum vitae;</hi> upon theſe words it is holden 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. That where Land was given to one and his heirs for the life of another, that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:95367:68"/>
upon ſuch an Eſtate, he in the reverſion ſhould be received, by reaſon of theſe words, <hi>vel alio modo ad terminum vitae, &amp;c.</hi> And although he who enters at the time of the recovery, was not next in remainder to the particular Eſtate, yet he is within the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. For he was in remainder at the time of the recovery, and at the time of the entry he in the immediate remainder was dead, and then he the next in remainder. <hi>Vide</hi> 15 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 9. by <hi>Litt.</hi> If I grant my Services to one for life, and he in a <hi>Praecipe</hi> brought againſt him, pleads in the right, or grants to another the ſaid Services in Fee, it is not a Forfeiture, for it is no Diſcontinuance. It will be objected, That the words of the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. are, That ſuch recoveries ſhall be utterly void, and if ſo, then he in the reverſion cannot be damnified, and then no cauſe of Forfeiture. So that it may be eaſily anſwered, That where Tenant for life doth any thing which ſounds to the diſinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of him in the reverſion, by matter of record, although the ſame doth not deveſt, or otherwiſe prejudice the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, yet it is a Forfeiture. <hi>Cook,</hi> to the contrary. Here in our Caſe is not any Covin in Sir <hi>William Pelham</hi> the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainee, he was deceived by the Bargainor; for he did not know but that the Bargainor was ſeized in tail according to the Covenant in the Indenture, by which the Bargainor cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted that he was ſeized in tail at the time of the Bargain; and alſo to do any other act for aſſurance of the Eſtate of the Bargainee; and it was lawful for him to Vouch his Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainor, and although he voucheth a ſtranger, it is not a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture. 39 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 16. Aid prayer of a ſtranger is a Forfeiture, and the reaſon of that is, becauſe he acknowledgeth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to be in a ſtranger, and that is the cauſe of Forfeiture. <hi>Vide Book of Entries</hi> 254. Where upon Aid prayer, the Party to have Aid ſhewed ſuch Special matter: But in our Caſe the Tenant for life hath vouched his Bargainor, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe, for he hath a warranty from him, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant cannot Counterplead it, for he had a Seiſin, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he might make a Feoffment. As to the Caſe 14 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Fitz. Reſceit</hi> 135. Leſſee for life in a <hi>Praecipe</hi> againſt him without Aid prayer pleadeth to the Enqueſt the firſt day, he in reverſion may enter: It is true, he may enter, and enter into the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceit, but not into the Land for a Forfeiture; For then <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herbert</hi> would have abridged that Caſe in the Title of <hi>Entre Congeable,</hi> and not in the Title of <hi>Reſceit:</hi> And the Book in 5 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 3. is good Law, for there the Tenant doth confeſs the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to be in another; but in our Caſe the Tenant vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, which is a lawful Act, and according to the Covenants of his Purchaſe. And although the recovery was by agreement, yet it is not for that a Forfeiture; for if the Tenant for life voucheth truly, it is not a Forfeiture. Before the Statute
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:95367:68"/>
of <hi>Weſt.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. which gave reſceit to a woman, and to thoſe in reverſion, where the particular Tenant is impleaded, and made default, <hi>&amp; reddere noluerit,</hi> no remedy for theſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but a Writ of Right, but no Entry; and that was for the credit which the Law gave to recoveries, <hi>car ſi puiſſoit,</hi> then is reſceit given, but that only in the two Caſes aforeſaid: But afterward, becauſe it was found that many particular Tenants being impleaded, would plead faintly: The Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 13 <hi>R.</hi> 2. gave reſceit in ſuch caſe. And upon what reaſons were theſe Acts made, if in ſuch caſes the Entry was lawful? But after theſe two Statutes, another practiſe was deviſed; for ſuch particular Tenants would ſuffer reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries ſecretly in ſuch ſort that thoſe in the reverſion could not have notice of it, ſo as they could not <hi>ante judicium,</hi> and prayer to be received; for the remedy of which miſchief the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. was made; by which, all recoveries had againſt the Tenant by the Curteſie, or otherwiſe for life or lives, by agreement of the Parties, of any Land whereof ſuch particular Tenant is ſeized, ſhould be void as Tenant by the Curteſie, &amp;c. ſhould be void againſt him in the reverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And yet an Evaſion was found out of that Statute; for ſuch particular Tenant would make a Feoffment with war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty, and then the Feoffor ſhould be impleaded in a Writ of Entry, and he vouch the Tenant for life, who ſhould vouch over, and ſuch a Recovery was out of the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. for the recovery was not againſt ſuch particular Tenant, &amp;c. For the remedy of which miſchief the Statute of 14 <hi>Eliz.</hi> was made; by which, it was provided that ſuch recoveries had, where ſuch particular Tenant ſhall be vouched, ſhould ve void, if ſuch recovery be had between them by Covin. And he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, That the Forfeiture is not in reſpect of the recovery it ſelf, but of the Plea pleaded by the Tenant: And here in our Caſe there is not any Covin found, or that Sir <hi>William Pelham</hi> knew that he was but Tenant for life; but it was found that the recovery was with their aſſent, and that was lawful, as this Caſe is, for they may agree to have ſuch reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very for further aſſurance; and ſo Sir <hi>William Pelham</hi> hath not vouched any but his Bargainor, and that according to their Covenants, and this Bargainor was not a bare Tenant for life, but had alſo a remainder in tail, although not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately depending upon the Eſtate for life, which he cut off; therefore it was not meerly a feigned recovery: And <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi> 5 <hi>E.</hi> 4.2. <hi>&amp; Br. Forfeiture</hi> 87. where Tenant for life being impleaded in a <hi>Praecipe</hi> voucheth a ſtranger, it is not a Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for it doth not diſaffirm the reverſion, &amp;c. <hi>contra</hi> of Aid prayer, for a ſtranger may releaſe with warranty to Tenant for life, upon which he may vouch: And he reported in his Argument, That <hi>Bromley</hi> Chancellor of <hi>England</hi> ſent him to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:95367:69"/>
the two chief Iuſtices to know their Opinions upon theſe Points, and they were of opinion, That the Voucher of a ſtranger was not any Forfeiture, and alſo that after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery was executed, he in the remainder could not enter; but they conceived that the right of him in the remainder was not bound: And he ſaid, That after the recovery executed, he in the remainder could not enter, which ſee <hi>Br. Forfeiture</hi> 87. 24 <hi>H.</hi> 8. For if Entry in ſuch Caſe had been lawful, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteneſs of Suits would follow, which would be a thing againſt the credit of recoveries. As to the Objection of the Infancy the ſame will not help the matter, 6 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Br. Saver default</hi> 30. Recovery had againſt an Infant in which he voucheth, and loſeth, is not erronious; contrary upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault: And if an Infant Tenant in tail ſuffereth a recovery, it is diſcontinuance, for in ſuch Recovery Infancy is not reſpected. And in a <hi>Scire Facias</hi> upon a Iudgment had againſt the Father, the Heir ſhall not have his age. And he cited a Caſe out of <hi>Bendlowes Reports,</hi> 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> Tenant for life, the remainder over to a ſtranger in Fee, Tenant for life is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeized by Covin, in a <hi>Praecipe quod reddat</hi> againſt the Diſſeiſor he voucheth the Tenant for life, who entreth into the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty generally, and voucheth over the common Vouchee, It was adjudged that that recovery was out of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. for the recovery was not had againſt the particular Tenant, but he was but Tenant in Law <hi>quia Vouchee;</hi> and alſo the recovery is a good bar to him in the remainder, notwithſtanding that he was within age at the time of the recovery. And at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time it was argued by the <hi>Barons,</hi> and <hi>Clark</hi> ſaid, That he conceived that the Entry of him in the remainder was lawful: It hath been objected that <hi>Pelham</hi> did not know that the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainor had but for life, or that any other perſon had any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder in the Land, that is to no purpoſe to excuſe him; for 42 <hi>E.</hi> 3. every Purchaſor ought at his own peril to take notice of the Eſtates and Charges upon the Lands which he purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth: For the Law preſumes that none will purchaſe without advice of Counſel, and without knowing the Titles of the Land. And although Statutes have been made to provide againſt the practiſes of particular Tenants, yet that is no Argument that no other remedy was before. And by <hi>Littleton,</hi> If Tenant for life joyneth the Miſe upon the meer right, it is a Forfeiture. And he held ſtrongly, That the Iudgment did not take away the Entry, a cauſe of Forfeiture being given before the Iudgment. 5 <hi>Aſſ</hi> 3. He in the Reverſion after Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Execution may enter. See alſo 22 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 31 to the ſame purpoſe. For where Tenant for life is impleaded he ought to wait upon him in the Reverſion, and expect Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from him in defence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore if he maketh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault, or confeſſeth the Action, it is a Forfeiture. And as to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:95367:69"/>
the ſuppoſed recompence, the ſame doth not help the Caſe, for this common Recovery is no other but an Aſſurance, and Recoverors are but Aſſignees, and they ſhall take advantage of Conditions by 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and a recoveror ſhall be ſeized to the uſe of him who ſuffers the recovery, if no other uſe be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. And he alſo held, that when Tenant for life bargains and ſells his Land by Deed inrolled; although no Fee paſſeth,<note place="margin">1 Leon. 264. 3 Inſt. 251. b. Mores r. 212. 2 Leon. 60, 65.</note> yet it is a Forfeiture; and that by reaſon of the Inrollment, which is matter of Record: And he ſaid, that if an Infant Tenant for life be diſſeiſed, the Diſſeiſor dyeth ſeized, and afterwards the Infant dyeth, that he in the remainder may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: <hi>Gent.</hi> to the ſame intent: If Tenant for life, &amp;c. the ſame is not ſimply a Forfeiture; for he may have a Warranty, or a Releaſe, or a Confirmation made to him: Attornment doth not give a right, but is only a conſent, yet if he who hath nothing in the reverſion will levy a Fine of it to another, and afterwards the Conuſee bringeth a <hi>Quid juris clamat</hi> againſt the tenant of the Land, and he Attorns, it is a Forfeiture. <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> to the ſame intent: This is a new Caſe, and I have not read the Caſe in any Book, nor ſeen any Preſident of it: And it is a great Caſe, and a general Caſe, and worthy to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued; and I conceive clearly, that here is a direct and expreſs Forfeiture at the Common Law, without any aid or reſtraint of any Statute to make it a Forfeiture: The dignity of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the repute of Law hath been urged which ought to ſtand in force until they be reverſed by Error, or Attaint; And alſo <hi>Littleton</hi> hath been urged 481. where upon the Statute of <hi>Weſt.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. he ſaith, that before the Statute aforeſaid, If a Leaſe had been made to one for life, the remainder to a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and afterwards a ſtranger by feigned Action had recovered againſt the tenant for life by default, and alſo the tenant for life dyed, that he in the remainder had not any remedy: But there <hi>Littleton</hi> doth not report the ſame as his own Opinion, but as an Opinion conceived by a remainder upon the ſaid Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute; and it is in truth but a meer conceit. And as to the main point he took this diverſity: Such Recoveries, in which the title of the demandant ſtands indifferently to the Court, and <hi>Non conſtat,</hi> if it be good or not, being ſuffered by tenant for life by default or confeſſion without Aid prayer of him in the reverſion, do not make any Forfeiture, although the tenant for life hath not dealt well with him in the reverſion, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving prayed in aid of him: And in ſuch Caſe, If a Leaſe be made for life, the remainder over in Fee upon ſuch a recovery, he in the remainder ſhall have a <hi>Formedon</hi> in the remainder, or a Writ of Right, and ſhall not ouſt him who recovered without Action, and that by the Common Law. Then came the Statute of <hi>Weſt.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. which gave to the Wife <hi>Cui in vita</hi> upon a Recovery againſt the Husband by default, whereas before ſhe
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:95367:70"/>
had not any recovery but a Writ of Right, and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her former recovery <hi>ulterius neceſſe habet oſtendere jus ſuum ſecundum formam brevis quod prius impetraverat,</hi> and if his right be not better than the right of him in the Reverſion, he ſhall loſe the Land, notwithſtanding the Iudgment given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for him: And that Statute gave Reſceit or Entry <hi>ad ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum qui praeteriit,</hi> and that Statute is to be intended of ſuch Recoveries where a good, or at leaſt an indifferent Title is ſo as <hi>non conſtat Curiae,</hi> if it be good or not: After that, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for life was driven to a near ſhift, and would not make default, or loſe by <hi>nient dedire,</hi> but would plead, but yet faintly; for the remedy of which Miſchief the Statute of 13 <hi>R.</hi> 2. was made, which gave Reſceit in ſuch Caſe; the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Tenant being reſtrained by that Statute: He jugled yet, and practiſed to ſuffer a Recover ſecretly, without notice of him in the Reverſion: To remedy which Miſchief the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. was made, and that made ſuch Recovery had againſt ſuch particular Tenant void againſt him in the Reverſion. It hath been objected, That the Statute of 32 <hi>H</hi> 8. doth not give any Forfeiture in that Caſe, but makes that the Recovery be void, therefore he in the reverſion ought to tarry till after the death of the particular Tenant: To that I ſhall ſpeak after. But how our Caſe is a common Recovery, and <hi>conſtat Curiae,</hi> that the Demandant hath not any right, for the Tenant might have barred him, and in truth he who recovereth is but a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſor: Alſo this recovery is not to the uſe of the recoverer, but to the uſe of him who was Tenant in it, and not para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount, as in the Caſe of a recovery upon a good title, a Leaſe for years made by him who after ſuffers a recovery, is good and ſhall not be defeated by the recoveree; otherwiſe it is where the recovery is upon a good Title. <hi>Vide Statute of Glouceſt, cap.</hi> 11. Where upon default of the Tenant, reſceipt is given for Leſſee for years, yet if the Tenant vouch upon default of the Vouchee, the Leſſee for years ſhall be received; and now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceipt of Leſſee for years is out of the Book, for by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 21 <hi>H.</hi> 8. he may falſifie: But no reſceipt lyeth in the Caſe of a common recovery, for he who recovereth cannot ouſt the Termor. As to that which my Brother <hi>Clark</hi> hath ſaid, That the Bargain and Sale in this Caſe is not any Forfeiture, but when the Deed of Bargain and Sale is inrolled it is a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture, I am not of that Opinion; for although that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollment be of record, yet the Deed is not of record: for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Deed inrolled a man may plead Infancy, although none can plead <hi>Non eſt factum</hi> to it. Alſo he held, that although by the Bargain and Sale, and the inrollment of it, the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainee had not Fee; for by ſuch act the reverſion is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; yet by the recovery, and the Execution of it, the Bargainee had gained the Fee out of the Leſſor; for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:95367:70"/>
is to the uſe of the Bargainee againſt whom it was had &amp;c. It hath been objected, That he is only a Voucher, which peradventure was lawful in this Caſe, by reaſon of the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty paramount, or of a releaſe or confirmation with War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty, and two Caſes have been vouched to ſuch purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> 5 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 2. Tenant for life being impleaded in a <hi>Praecipe,</hi> vouched a ſtranger, the Demandant counterpleaded the Voucher, which was found for him, he in the reverſion had no remedy but by a Writ of Right: So if the Vouchee had entred and loſt, &amp;c. As to that Caſe we ought to conſider, That every Book re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in our Law is not Law: But let us obſerve of what Authority the Caſe is, truly it is the conceit of the Reporter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for he puts the Caſe, and reſolves it: but there is no Iudge or Serjeant named in the Caſe, &amp;c. The other Caſe is 5 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 2. Note by <hi>Hendon</hi> clearly; If my Tenant for life voucheth a ſtranger who entreth into the Warranty generally, and doth not know how to bar the Demandant, the Tenant ſhall recover in value, and the reverſion of him who hath in value ſhall be to me in lieu of my former reverſion: as releaſe to Tenant for life ſhall enure to him in the reverſion: But that is but the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of one Serjeant, &amp;c. But I anſwer to theſe Books, If the Demandant in ſuch recovery have a good title ſo as the Tenant, or the Voucher, as <hi>Hendon</hi> ſaith, know not how to bar the Demandant there ſuch a Voucher of a Stranger is not a Forfeiture, nor ſuch recovery ſuffered thereupon: for againſt his will and <hi>volens nolens</hi> he ſuffered it: But if the Tenant had good matter to bar the Demandant, and no good cauſe of Voucher, that the vouching of a ſtranger, or ſuffering of a recovery is a Forfeiture of his Eſtate: And here in our Caſe, the Defendant had not any title, The Tenant or Vouchee had not any Warranty, or cauſe of Voucher; But the Tenant might have barred the Demandant if he pleaſed. And he ſaid, That the Voucher only doth not make the Forfeiture; but much rather the Recovery; for when Iudgment is given, and Execution had, then is the Fee plucked out of him in the rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. 6 <hi>R.</hi> 2. If Tenant for life claimeth a Fee it is a Forfeiture; but here <hi>Pelham</hi> hath done more, for he hath gained Fee by the Iudgment, therefore <hi>à Fortiori</hi> it ſhall be a Forfeiture. But let us a little ſee, what medlings or attempts by the particular Tenant, are cauſes of a Forfeiture, and what not, 5 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 3. Where <hi>A.</hi> brings an Entry againſt Tenant for life by colluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ouſt <hi>B.</hi> of his reverſion, ſuppoſing that the Tenant for life held of his Leaſe: The Tenant confeſſeth the Action, upon which Iudgment is given, <hi>B</hi> enters, and his entry adjudged lawful; for that recovery is adjudged in Law but an Alienation to the diſinheriſin of him in the reverſion; and here it appears That ſuch recovery by Covin, is but an Alienation, and without any ſtrength of a recovery. And he cited many other Caſes cited
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:95367:71"/>
before by <hi>Altham,</hi> 14 <hi>E</hi> 3. <hi>Reſceit</hi> 135. Where Tenant for life pleads in chief, or prays in aid of a ſtranger where he might bar the Demandant, and will not, it is a Forfeiture: And alſo 22 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 27 <hi>E.</hi> 3. where Tenant for life in a <hi>Quid ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris clamat</hi> Attorns unto the Conuſee upon a Fine levyed by him who hath not any thing in the Land, the ſame is a Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and yet that Attornment doth not divert the Reverſion out of the Leſſor. 50 <hi>E.</hi> 3.7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8. Land was given by Fine in tail, the remainder over to a ſtranger in Fee, the Donee took a Wife, and dyed without Iſſue, the Wife accepted Dower aſſigned by a ſtranger, he in the Remainder brought a <hi>Scire facias</hi> againſt the Wife, that ſhe is Tenant in Dower of the Aſſignment of a ſtranger, and pleaded to the Title, the Demandant reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, ſhe hath loſt her Dower, for ſhe hath not pleaded dutifully as ſhe ought, being a particular Tenant. <hi>Temps H.</hi> 4. Tenant for life loſeth his Land in a Recovery againſt him againſt his will, and thereupon brings <hi>Quod ei deforceat,</hi> and declares up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Eſtate tail, and recovers, the ſame is a Forfeiture, becauſe he hath challenged a higher Eſtate, &amp;c. 5 <hi>H.</hi> 7. Tenant for life joyns the Miſe upon the meer Right. 2 <hi>H.</hi> 6. Leſſee for years being ouſted, brings an Aſſiſe and recovers. 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. Accepts a Fine of a ſtranger <hi>ſur Conuſans, &amp;c. come ceo que il ad de ſon done.</hi> All theſe are Forfeitures. In our principal Caſe here, the Tenant who ſuffered the Recovery did not plead at all to defend the Right; but where he might have barred the Demandant, he gave ſtrength to his pretended Title, and made it a perfect Title, and by ſuffering the Recovery and Iudgment to paſs, had taken away the Reverſion out of the Leſſor to whom he owed Fealty, and therefore it is a Forfeiture: And without doubt it is apparent to the Court, that the Demandant in this Recovery hath not any Title; for the Recoverers in ſuch Caſes are but Aſſignees and Purchaſors: which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by the Statute of 7 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. which gives Diſtreſs and Avowry to Recoverers, &amp;c. As to the inventing of Recoveries, it was a neceſſary Device; for it was to take away Eſtate tails which were the cauſes of grand Miſchiefs and Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in this Realm; and it was great reaſon, for Tenant in tail might by the Common Law alien his Land <hi>poſt prolem ſuſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat,</hi> and then he had an Inheritance and might commit Waſte: But he was ſo reſtrained by the Statute of <hi>Weſtm.</hi> 2. all the Realm, and the Subjects of it, were inveigled thereby; Ioyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Wives, Leaſes of Farmers Mortgages to Creditors, Statutes, and other Aſſurances defeated by their deaths, which was againſt the Common Law and all Conſcience: Theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters tending to the knowledge of the Iuſtices, and the Miſchiefs thereupon enſuing very frequent, and that Tenant in tail was become a perillous Fellow, and there was no ſafe dealing with him; Then they taking into conſideration that ſeveral War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranties
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:95367:71"/>
and Aſſets, and collateral Warranty without Aſſets, for that in it ſelf implyed Aſſets did bar him, <hi>Icil.</hi> the Entail, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that conſideration they grounded the practice and uſage of common Recoveries; ſo that by that means Tenant in tail has <hi>poteſtatem alienandi,</hi> as he had at the Common Law, becauſe his authority was reſtored to him, and injury done to no man: But as to Tenant for life, he never had <hi>poteſtatem alienandi:</hi> And as to that which hath been ſaid, That the Recovery ſhall ſtand in force till after the death of the Tenant for life; and in our Caſe here, Tenant in tail is living; certainly if the Law ſhould be ſuch, great miſchief would follow, for then greater Ioyntreſſes, the Widows of great Perſons, having allowed unto them great and ſumptuous Houſes, and Lands furniſhed with Timber of great value, might ſuffer ſuch Recoveries and ſo having plucked the Fee out of the Heirs, might commit Waſte, and the ſame ſhould be diſpuniſhable, &amp;c. which ſhould be an intolerable Miſchief. And ſo he concluded that this ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of a Recovery was a Forfeiture, and Iudgment was given accordingly.</p>

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:95367:73"/>
made after the beginning of the Queens Reign, and before the Treaſon committed by Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> and before the Statute of 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> againſt Fugitives, and omitting alſo the laſt clauſe of the tender of the King; and this he offered openly in the Court of the <hi>Exchequer</hi> the ſame day: After which the Queen being moved with the ſaid Condition, made a Warrant by Letters Patents under the Great Seal, dated 17 <hi>Martii,</hi> 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> to <hi>Rich. Broughton</hi> and <hi>Henry Bourcher</hi> Eſquires for her, and in her place and ſtead, to deliver or tender to the ſaid <hi>Francis</hi> the Nephew a Ring of Gold, to the intent to make void the uſes and limitations limited by the ſaid Indenture, and to return their proceedings upon it into the Court of <hi>Exchequer;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they made a tender of a Ring of Gold to the ſaid <hi>Francis</hi> the Nephew the 18 day of <hi>November,</hi> 31 <hi>Eliz.</hi> which he refuſed to receive. And the two years after the ſaid Seſſion of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was the 13 day of <hi>March</hi> 31 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Brough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and <hi>Bourcher</hi> returned all this that they had done as before, with their Commiſſion out of the <hi>Exchequer:</hi> And this Caſe being a great caſe, and conſiſting of many doubts and queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, was often argued. And this Term, <hi>ſcil.</hi> 33 <hi>Eliz.</hi> It was argued by <hi>Moor</hi> of Counſel on the part of <hi>Francis Englefield;</hi> and he ſaid, when Sir <hi>Francis Englefield</hi> covenanted to ſtand ſeized to the uſe of himſelf for life, &amp;c. this was not any new uſe, but part of the ancient uſe which was in Sir <hi>Francis</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for there was no Conſideration to raiſe a new uſe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; for a Conſideration is a cauſe, or an occaſion meritorial requiring a mutual recompence in fait, or in Law, <hi>Dyer</hi> 16 <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz.</hi> 33. <hi>b. mutual.</hi> 1. of each part, and here this ancient uſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth. For Sir <hi>Francis</hi> cannot <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel</hi> agree and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and here is a bare Covenant without any Conſideration on the part of Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> which ſee <hi>Dr. and Student</hi> 100. ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Br. Feoffments to Uſes</hi> 46. A man cannot limit an uſe to himſelf to be a new uſe upon an Eſtate executed, as upon a Feoffment, but it ſhall be the ancient uſe; much leſs upon a Covenant. And that was <hi>Milfords Caſe, Paſch.</hi> 31 <hi>Eliz. Rot.</hi> 154 in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> where an uſe limited to the right Heirs of the Feoffor was holden the ancient uſe, <hi>quod vide</hi> alſo in the caſe of the Earl of <hi>Bedford,</hi> and there is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our caſe and the ſaid caſes, unleſs in the ſaid caſes the uſe is limited in the end, and in our caſe in the beginning of the Conveyance. But perhaps it will be Objected, That the particular Eſtate ſhall be good for neceſſity for to ſupport the Eſtate limited in the Remainder, which is limited upon good conſideration, for otherwiſe the Remainder ſhall be diſtrained: That is not any reaſon, for that conceit in <hi>Bayntons</hi> caſe in <hi>Plow. Com.</hi> 307. 8 <hi>Eliz.</hi> hath been over-voted to be no Law in the caſe of the Lord <hi>Paget</hi> in this Court very lately. And he ſaid, That the condition conceived in the <hi>Proviſo</hi> is not given to the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:95367:74"/>
King. By the Common Law in caſe of <hi>Eſcheat,</hi> the party comes in the Poſt; but a Condition runs in privity: And although the Statute of 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. gives to the King Conditions, yet it doth not give the performance of them, or ability to the King to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them. And there are three Reaſons wherefore this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition cannot paſs to the King: 1. There is a Condition in the <hi>Proviſo</hi> which precedes the Condition of the Tender, <hi>viz.</hi> If the ſaid <hi>Francis</hi> my Nephew be given to intolerable Vices, then if the ſaid Sir <hi>Francis</hi> deliver or offer, &amp;c. and in the whole pleading it is not averred, that the Nephew was given to intolerable Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; therefore the precedent Condition not being performed, the ſecond Condition is not ripened, nor in ſeaſon. 2. The ſubſtance of this Condition conſiſts in the will and pleaſure of Sir <hi>Fr. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glefield,</hi> therefore it cannot be given to the Queen. 3. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice which ſhould come to <hi>Francis</hi> the Nephew if this Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould come to the Queen, <hi>Vide Br. Temps H.</hi> 8. A Founder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip cannot Eſcheat, or be forfeited by Attainder of Felony or Treaſon, for it is a thing annexed to the Blood which cannot be ſeparated; and he ſaid alſo that the Condition was gon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that tender, for the Conveyance by which the Condition was granted, was made void by the Act of 29 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. by which it is Enacted, That every perſon within two years after the laſt day of this Seſſion ſhall openly ſhew and bring forth into the <hi>Exchequer</hi> his Conveyance, and there in the Term time, in open Court ſhall Exhibit the ſame to be entred and inrolled of Record; and here the end of the Seſſion was ſuch, that all the Terms of the ſaid two years were paſſed before the tender made by the Queen; and although the two years were not paſt, yet all the Terms were paſt, and the Conveyance ought to be ſhewed in Term time, therefore the true time is incurred before the Tender, and then the Conveyance is void, and by that the Condition gon. When the Queen was Tenant for the life of Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> and makes a Leaſe for years, and afterwards by the Condition hath the Inheritance, if now ſhe ſhall avoid the Leaſe made by her when ſhe was Tenant for life? A Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſor makes a Leaſe, or grants a Rent-charge, and afterwards the Diſſeiſee releaſes unto him, he ſhall not avoid his own Act. A man ſeized in the right of his Wife makes a Leaſe for years, hath Iſſue, and ſo is intitled to be Tenant by the curteſie; the Wife dyeth, he ſhall not avoid his Leaſe: Feoffor and Feoffee upon condition joyn in a Leaſe for years, the Condition is performed on the part of the Feoffor, he ſhall not avoid his Leaſe: And the Prerogative of the Queen ſhall not alter the matter againſt <hi>aequum &amp; bonum:</hi> As to the Statute of 29 <hi>Eliz.</hi> it was not the intent of that to avoid Eſtates claimed for, or by the Queen; for the Eſtate was made for the benefit of the Queen. As to the words of the Statute, every perſon or perſons which hath, or claimeth to have, &amp;c. the Queen is not
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:95367:74"/>
within the words. If a Statute ordains attendance, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of any Liberty which was before at the Common Law, there the Queen ſhall not be within it: As to attendance, the Queen is not bound to make claim upon a Fine levied: As to re-grant, the Queen is not bound by the Statute of <hi>Weſtm.</hi> 3. <hi>Quia emptores terrarum:</hi> alſo where matter of penalty is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. Alſo here is an Oath to be taken, &amp;c. the Queen being Tenant for the life of another, leaſeth the Woods, and grants to the Leſſee power to cut the Woods, and convert them to his own uſe. Now, if after the Inheritance cometh to the Queen, if the Queen may impeach her Grantee; truly the property of the Woods and Trees was in the Queen at the time of the Grant, and although the Inheritance came to the Queen after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, yet the ſame ſhall not overthrow the firſt Intereſt of the Grantee. Leſſee for life, or for years, before the Statute of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> could not be impeached for Waſte; therefore, as I conceive, the property of the Trees was in him, for there was no remedy for them againſt him. See the reaſon of that in <hi>Dr.</hi> and <hi>Student, Quaſi,</hi> the property of the Trees paſs to the Leſſee with the Demiſe, which ſhall be taken ſtrongly againſt the Leſſor. If the Leſſee cutteth the Trees, the Leſſor ſhall not have Treſpaſs againſt him, nor Detinue for the Trees. Leſſee without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of Waſte cutteth the Trees, and leaves them upon the Land, and dyes, his Executors ſhall have them, and not the Leſſor. The Leſſor grants <hi>omnes boſcos, &amp; arbores ſuas,</hi> nothing paſſeth, for they paſs to the Leſſee, if they be not excepted. The Leſſor againſt his own Leaſe cuts the Trees without the agreement of the Leſſee, Treſpaſs lyeth, 5 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 56. The Heir being in Ward, cut Trees in his Lands in the poſſeſſion of his Guardian, who brought an Action againſt the Heir, it was adjudged maintainable, although the Free-hold was in the Heir. <hi>Egerton</hi> Solicitor to the contrary. Admit the uſe in Sir <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> be the ancient uſe, yet it is but for life; and then when the Queen, having the Eſtate of Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> makes a Leaſe for 40 years, with the grant of the woods, the ſaid Leaſe was void, for the Queen was deceived in her Grant: Sir <hi>Francis</hi> was puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for Waſte; therefore the Queen having his Intereſt, ought not in Iuſtice to have cut the great Wood. And it is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, That if the Queen had known the ſmallneſs of her E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, ſhe would not have made ſo great a Leaſe, nor ſuch a Grant of the Wood. The King ſeized of Land in his own right, reciting by his Letters Patents, that he hath it by Attainder of <hi>J. S.</hi> gives the ſame to another, the Gift is void. The King licenceth one to appropriate an Advowſon, without being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that the ſame is holden in chief, it is void. A licence to alien, whereas in truth the Land is holden in tail, the Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or Remainder in the King, is alſo void; and here in our caſe, the Queen hath but a particular Eſtate for the life of another,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:95367:75"/>
and here out of that petty Eſtate is drawn a Leaſe for 40 years, where Leſſee for life was 60 years of age at the leaſt, and alſo a Grant of all the Trees: If the Queen hath a particular Eſtate, and grants <hi>totum Statum ſuum,</hi> without reciting of ſuch parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Eſtate, the Grant is void; the Queen hath the Profits of the Lands of one who is Outlawed in a perſonal Action, and grants to another the Land it ſelf, it is void, for it is a wrong to a third perſon, which the King cannot do. But here, the Special Intereſt of the Queen ought to be recited; Now when the Queen being Tenant for the life of another, makes Leaſes <hi>ut ſupra,</hi> and afterwards the Fee cometh to the Queen, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate out of which the Leaſes are derived being determined, the Leaſes alſo are determined, <hi>ſcil</hi> the Eſtate for the life of another by the acceſſion of the Fee-ſimple, and the Queen is in by a new right: It was adjudged 29 <hi>Eliz.</hi> here, That where the Queen had the Land of a Fugitive for the life of another, and leaſed the ſame to another <hi>Quam diu in manibus noſtris fore conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerit</hi> and after the Fee-ſimple of the Fugitive came to the Queen by his Attainder, the ſame Leaſe was void. King <hi>E.</hi> 6. gave to his Siſter <hi>Mary Manerium de B.</hi> for her life, <hi>ſecundum tenorem &amp; effectum Teſtamenti ſive ultimae voluntatis</hi> of King <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. whoſe Will was, that ſhe ſhould have it as long as ſhe remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married; ſhe granted a Rent-charge, King <hi>E.</hi> 6. dyed, by which the Fee deſcended to the ſaid <hi>Mary,</hi> being Queen of <hi>England:</hi> and afterwards ſhe married. He made it a <hi>Quaere,</hi> if the Rent be not gone. <hi>Dyer</hi> 3 <hi>&amp;</hi> 4 <hi>Phil. &amp; Mary</hi> 240. But <hi>Bendloes</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports the ſame Caſe to be adjudged, That the Rent was gone. Sir <hi>Francis Englefield</hi> 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> with leave of the Queen went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea, his Licence expired, the Queen directed to him a Privy Seal with her Commandment to return, which he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but did not return, but adhered to the Queens Enemies there, upon which the Queen ſeized his Lands, and 8 <hi>Eliz.</hi> grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Manor parcel thereof, and all profits thereof, <hi>quam diu in manibus noſtris fore contigerit,</hi> afterwards by Act 14 <hi>Eliz.</hi> (for there was ſome doubt if the Queen might make Leaſes, grant Copyholds or uſual Woodfalls of ſuch Lands, or only take the ordinary profits thereof, as <hi>veſturam terrae</hi>) it is explained, that during the Intereſt of the Queen, ſhe might do, <hi>ut ſupra,</hi> as Tenant for the life of another might do, upon which a new Seizure was made for the Queen, and a Steward appointed by the Queens Letters Patents, who held a Court, and took Surrenders in the hand of the Queen, and granted Admittan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp;c. And it was reſolved by the two Chief Iuſtices, That the two Seizures gave not the Queen any other or better Seiſin in the ſaid Manor than ſhe had before, by the firſt Seizure at the Common Law, notwithſtanding both the ſaid Statutes, and ſo the Courts holden by the Queen void, and all Surrenders and Admittances alſo: And ſo it is adjudged 23 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 375. upon
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:95367:75"/>
which it may be concluded, That if by the ſaid Statutes, or any of them had had a new right, the laſt Copy had been good, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Grant of the Manor before: Alſo for 8 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> the King grants <hi>Cuſtodiam terrae &amp; haeredis quam diu in manibus noſtris fore contigerit,</hi> the Heir being a Daughter, and after a Son is born, now the Grant of the King is void; Tenant in tail, the Reverſion in the King diſcontinues, the Diſcontinuee is attainted, the King ſeizeth, and leaſeth for years, Tenant in tail is attainted of Treaſon; now the Queen ſhall avoid her own Leaſe. So if the Diſſeiſor be attainted, upon which the Queen ſeiſeth, and leaſeth, and afterwards the Diſſeiſee is attainted: And he cited the Caſe of the <hi>Abbot</hi> of <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> The <hi>Abbot</hi> committed Treaſon, and afterwards by the Statute, or by Surrender, the <hi>Abby</hi> came to the Crown, who leaſed the Land for years, the <hi>Abbot</hi> is attainted of the ſaid Treaſon; now the King ſhall be ſeized by force of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder, and ſhall avoid his Leaſe. As to the Leaſes made to the Defendant by the Queen, one was made after the Statute of 29 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and the ſame is not ſaved by the ſaving there; for the words are, of Eſtates then <hi>in eſſe.</hi> 1. Such Eſtate as they had before the making of the Act: As to Leaſes made before they are drowned in the Fee-ſimple, which accrued to the King by the Attainder &amp;c. and here by this Statute, the Eſtate of the Queen for the life of another is not ſaved by the Statute, and then the Leaſes derived out of it are not ſaved. The Queen is not bound by the ſaid Statute to exhibit any Conveyance, for ſhe ſhall not take any Oath, according to the Statute; and if the Queen be not within the Body of the Act, ſhe is not within the ſaving. Now as to the Condition, The Statute of 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. gives to the Queen Vſes, Rights, Conditions. It hath been Objected, That ſuch Conditions are intended to be given to the King, which are to be performed on the part of the Donee, Leſſee, Grantee, Covenantee, but not on the part of the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, &amp;c. For it was in the will of the Grantor if he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them or not, and a Will cannot be transferred over. But as to that it may be anſwered, That a Will by Parliament may be transferred over, for <hi>Parliamentum omnia poteſt.</hi> It hath been Objected. If that ſhall be ſaid the Will of Sir <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis.</hi> which now is the Will of the Queen, it ſhall be a great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to <hi>Francis Englefield</hi> the Nephew; for now he ſhall be doubly bridled by his Vncle, and by the Queen. It hath been Objected, That here is a Conditional Condition, 1. If the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew ſhall be given to intolerable Vices, and it is not added to enable the Queen to take advantage of the Condition, that he is otherwiſe than of good behavior and converſation but the words of the <hi>Proviſo</hi> clear the matter, 1. Leſt he ſhould be given to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable Vices, and not if he be given, &amp;c. So as it is not a Condition to a Condition, but a Motive to a Condition. And
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:95367:76"/>
the Statute of 29 <hi>Eliz.</hi> by which Sir <hi>Francis</hi> was attainted, gives to the King all conditions. It hath been objected, that in the ſaid Statute of 29 <hi>Eliz.</hi> is a ſaving, by which Leaſes made by the Queen are preſerved: But if that <hi>Proviſo</hi> be well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, it doth not extend to our caſe. 1. That Act extends to make void any Grant, Leaſe, &amp;c. made by the Queen after the Treaſon committed, &amp;c. but that ſhall be of ſuch force, as if the ſaid Act had not been made. As to that I ſay, That this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute doth not add or detract from ſuch Leaſes, but leaves them as it found them; for the Statute gives to the Queen the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which Condition avoids the ſaid Leaſes; for it avoids the Eſtate of the Queen out of which the ſaid Leaſes are deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: And although that the Conveyance, as to the benefit of Sir <hi>Francis</hi> or his Nephew, be void by the Statute for not Inroll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, yet it is not utterly void as to the Queen alſo. The Statute of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> Enacts, That Leaſes made by Biſhops againſt the Form of the Statute, ſhall be void: Yet they ſhall not be void againſt the Biſhop himſelf or againſt the Leſſor: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception hath been taken, for that the tender of the King is not found by Office: But he needs no Office, for the tender is the Act of the Queen her ſelf, there ſhe ought not to be informed of it; for to what purpoſe ſhall the Queen be certified of that which ſhe her ſelf hath done: The Queen makes a Leaſe for years, upon Condition that the Leſſee ſurrender to her the Manor of <hi>B</hi> here for the not doing of it, no Office is requiſite. Tenant of the King <hi>in Capite</hi> aliens by Fine, that needs no Office, for that appears upon Record; ſo here. And although the Condition be returned in the <hi>Exchequer</hi> after the Term; yet it is well enough, for the <hi>Exchequer</hi> is never ſhut, as to take and receive Money, Certificates made to be Inrolled; although it be ſhut as to all Iudicial Acts. And although no tender at all be certified, it is not to the purpoſe, for the tender makes the Eſtate void without any other thing: And it is not like to a <hi>Capias ad ſatisfaciendum,</hi> for that is <hi>Ita quod Habeas Corpus, &amp;c.</hi> therefore the Arreſt is not ſufficient by it ſelf; but the ſame ought to be remembred with an <hi>Ita. quod, &amp;c.</hi> But as to that which hath been ſaid, That the Queen ſhall not avoid her own Leaſe, the ſame is not ſo, nor in caſe of a common Perſon: As if Tenant in tail enfeoffeth his Heir within age, who makes a Leaſe for years at his full age, Tenant in tail dyes, Now the Iſſue ſhall avoid his own Leaſe, for he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: A Diſſeiſor levies a Fine to a ſtranger, the Diſſeiſee enters upon the Conuſee, and enfeoffs the Diſſeiſor, now he ſhall avoid his own Fine, <hi>à multo fortiori</hi> in the Caſe of the King. Now it is to ſee. If the Grant of the Wood by the Queen, being Tenant for the term of anothers life, be good, or not. He conceived it was not; for ſhe was deceived in her Grant, not knowing that ſhe was but a particular Tenant: It
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:95367:76"/>
was Objected, That the Queen hath property and right in the Trees and Woods, foraſmuch as no Waſte or Treſpaſs lyeth againſt her if ſhe caſt them down: Certainly the Leſſee, if the Trees and Woods be not excepted, hath the property in them, but not the abſolute property, for the Writ of Waſte ſhall ſay, <hi>ad exhaered' Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>erentis,</hi> for he cannot cut them, <hi>Id enim tantum poſſumus, quod de jure poſſumus,</hi> perhaps the Leſſee ſhall have the Wind-falls, becauſe they are ſevered from the Inheritance by the act of God, not of the Leſſee himſelf; and ſee 27 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>Waſte</hi> 8. and alſo in <hi>Statham titulo Waſte. A.</hi> leaſeth to <hi>B.</hi> for life, without impeachment of Waſte, a ſtranger cuts Trees, and the Leſſee brings Treſpaſs, he ſhall not recover damages for the value of the Trees; for the property of the Body and the Tree is in him who hath the Reverſion, he may give it, by which it appeareth, that the Leſſee is not to recover, but only for the cropping and the breaking of his Cloſe, <hi>à fortiori</hi> in caſe where the Leaſe is made without the clauſe <hi>abſque impetitione vaſti,</hi> as the Caſe at bar is: And therefore when the Queen having ſo feeble an Eſtate, makes ſuch a Grant, <hi>ſcil.</hi> Grants all the Woods &amp;c. the Grant is void, for ſhe was deceived in her Grant; by which (if it ſhould be good) ſhe ſhould wrong her Subject: A Grant to the Queen ſhall have a reaſonable conſtruction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Grant of a common Perſon. <hi>A.</hi> grants to the Queen Common in all his Lands, the Queen by that Grant ſhall not have Common, but in Lands commonable, not in his Land where his Corn is growing, or in his Orchard, or Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens: Tenant for life grants all the Wood upon his Land, nothing paſſeth but that which he may lawfully grant. So in Caſes of Grants of the King, 22 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 49. the King grants to one <hi>bona &amp; catalla tenent' ſuorum, fugitivorum &amp; qualitercunque dampnorum;</hi> the Grantee ſhall not have the Goods and Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels of one who hath killed the Kings Meſſenger. So in Grants of Amercements, the Grantee ſhall not have a Special Amerce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp;c. So here, the Grant of all Woods ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended of ſuch Woods (as Vnderwoods) which the Queen might lawfully grant without wrong to another. And he ſaid, That when the Queen hath granted the Land and the Woods for 40 years, that Grant cannot be divided; and the words of the Grant are, <hi>That it ſhall be lawful to cut the Woods during the ſpace of</hi> 43 <hi>years:</hi> Now foraſmuch as the Leaſe is ſurrendred <hi>ut ſupra,</hi> the liberty of cutting the Woods is gon alſo. A man bargains and ſells his Manor with all Woods upon it grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Deed is not Inrolled, ſo as the Manor doth not paſs, the Woods ſhall not paſs in groſs, for the Grant ſhall not be divided.

date 18 <hi>October,</hi> leaſed the ſame Land to the ſame Plaintiff for 21 years to begin at <hi>Michaelmas</hi> before, and in pleading, it was ſhewed, That <hi>virtute cujus dimiſſionis (poſterioris)</hi> the Plaintiff entred, <hi>&amp; fuit poſſeſſ. craſtino Michaelis.</hi> which was before the making of the Leaſe, and the Plaintiff in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration declared, That the Defendant in conſideration that the Plaintiff had aſſigned to him the ſaid Leaſes, had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to pay to him 630 <hi>l.</hi> It was found for the Plaintiff. <hi>Cook,</hi> For where the Plaintiff in an Action upon the Caſe declares upon two Conſiderations, in ſuch Caſe although the one be void, yet if the other be good and ſufficient, the Action is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable, but the Damages ſhall be given without reſpect had to the Conſideration inſufficient, and the Plaintiff was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare upon both Conſiderations; for the <hi>Aſſumpſit</hi> upon which the Action is conceived, was in conſideration that both the Leaſes were aſſigned to the Defendant, and our Declaration ought to be according to the <hi>Aſſumpſit,</hi> and it was not mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, although that one of the Conſiderations was utterly void. Another Exception was taken, Becauſe the Leaſe is ſet forth to be made 18 <hi>October,</hi> and that by virtue thereof the Plaintiff entred, <hi>Cro. Mich.</hi> Then the Plaintiff entring <hi>Cro.

But <hi>Cook</hi> ſaid, That ſhall not hurt us, for it is but matter of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſage to ſay, <hi>Virtute cujus, &amp;c.</hi> As 20 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 15. the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff in Treſpaſs ſuppoſed by his Declaration, that the Treſpaſs for which the Action was brought, commenced 10 <hi>H.</hi> 6. with a <hi>Continuando</hi> until the day of the Action brought, <hi>viz. idem</hi> 14 <hi>Febr.</hi> 17 <hi>H.</hi> 6. where the Writ bore date 12 <hi>die Octobris, Anno</hi> 17 <hi>H.</hi> 6.

But the Exception was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, for it is certain enough before the <hi>viz.</hi> the day of Writ brought, and ſo the <hi>viz,</hi> is void, and all that which follows upon it. And ſo here, this Clauſe <hi>Virtute cujus eſt, totum ſequitur eſt omnino</hi> void, 7 <hi>H.</hi> 4.44. <hi>Br. Action upon the Caſe</hi> 37. The Writ was <hi>Quare Toloniam aſportavit, &amp; illud ſolvere recuſavit.</hi> Exception was taken to the repugnancy, for it would not be carried away, if it were not paid before; yet the Writ was awarded good, and the firſt word <hi>Toloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am aſportavit</hi> holden void: So here in the principal Caſe. As to the other Exception, it is clear, That here is not any Diſſeiſin upon this Entry of the Plaintiff before the making of the ſaid Leaſe; for there was a Communication betwixt the Parties of ſuch a Leaſe to be made, or of ſuch an Aſſignment, and peradventure the Entry was by aſſent of the other part, and then no Diſſeiſin. And <hi>poſito,</hi> it ſhould
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:95367:78"/>
be a Diſſeiſin, yet the Plaintiff hath aſſigned all the Intereſt <hi>quod ipſe tunc habuit,</hi> according to the conſideration, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the Defendant both the Indentures of Demiſes, and ſo he hath granted all that which he might grant: And if it be a void Aſſignment or not, is not material, for <hi>quacunque via da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> the Conſideration is good, and then the <hi>Aſſumpſit</hi> good al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. <hi>Egerton</hi> Solicitor contrary: In every Action upon the Caſe upon <hi>Aſſumpſit,</hi> three things ought to concur, Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Promiſe, and breath of Promiſe; and in this Caſe the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignment of the Leaſe to begin after the death of the Leſſor, is void, being but Tenant for life, and no Conſideration upon the confeſſion of the Plaintiff himſelf. And upon the ſecond Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration it appeareth, the Leſſor, <hi>viz.</hi> the Wife who held for life, had but a right to the Land demiſed, for ſhe was diſſeiſed; for he to whom the Land was after let, entred before the Leaſe was made; for it doth not appear that he entred by force of any agreement made before the Leaſe; therefore by his Entry he was a Diſſeiſor. It was alſo moved, That here was not any ſufficient conſideration, for by a bare or naked delivery <hi>Nihil operatur;</hi> and here is not any word of <hi>Give</hi> or <hi>Grant.</hi> To which it was anſwered, That the delivery of the Indenture was not a bare Bailment, but a Delivery to the uſe in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture, and ſo it is pleaded, and therefore thereby an Intereſt paſſed, for ſuch a delivery cannot be countermanded.

By <hi>Bracton, Jus,</hi> concerning a real thing, is threefold: 1. <hi>Jus terrae, ſcil.</hi> the Ownerſhip of the Land. 2. <hi>Jus in terra,</hi> as a Rent, Common, &amp;c. 3. <hi>Jus ad terram, ſcil.</hi> Right permanent. And by this Common Recovery in our caſe <hi>Jus terrae</hi> ſhall be bound, but not <hi>Jus in terra:</hi> And he ſaid, That if Land be given to <hi>A.</hi> in tail, the Remainder to the Kings Villain in Fee, and before any claim by the King, <hi>A.</hi> ſuffers a common Recovery and dyes without Iſſue, this Recovery ſhall not bind the King. And as to the Caſe of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 2. which hath been Objected againſt the falſifying of the Recovery, where a Parſon made a Leaſe for years, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> brought againſt him and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, they pleaded faintly, to the intent to make the Leſſee loſe his Term, now ſuch a Leſſee cannot falſifie; in ſuch caſe the Parſon by another way might have defeated the Leaſe as by Reſignation; but in our caſe the Grantor of this Rent by
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:95367:81"/>
no way might defeat his Grant: And he ſaid, a common recovery did not bind Dower, therefore nor this rent. And if Tenant in tail in poſſeſſion grants ſuch a rent, and after ſuffers a common recovery, the rent ſhall ſtand, why not alſo in the caſe of a remainder; for upon them both, as well the remainder, as the poſſeſſion, the recovery <hi>operatur:</hi> And recoveries ſhall always bind the poſſeſſion, and no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſhall not diſprove the right, but the poſſeſſion. And the recovery by it ſelf doth not bind the poſſeſſion, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Voucher, without which no recovery ſhall bar, and that in reſpect of the recompence which the Law pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes, &amp;c. which recompence cannot extend to this Rent-charge, and then there is no reaſon that he to whom it was granted ſhould be prejudiced by this recovery; and always in caſe of recompence the Law is very preciſe. As if I grant unto you an Annuity of 30 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> until you be preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a competent Benefice, a litigious Benefice is not a recompence intended, nor ſhall determine the Annuity, nor a Benefice of 15 <hi>l.</hi> If two make an exchange for their Lives, and one of them dyeth, the exchange is not determined but the Heir of him who dyeth ſhall enter and retain the Land as long as the other ſhall live. <hi>Ad quod Manwod</hi> Chief Baron <hi>ſubſidebat:</hi> And there is a great difference between a Leaſe for years and a Rent-charge; for at the Common Law up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch Recovery the Leſſee for years was bound, contrary of a Rent-charge; for it was unreaſonable that a thing not demanded by the recovery ſhould be bound by it, eſpecially becauſe that the Land rendred in value ſhall not be charged with the rent. <hi>Walmeſley</hi> Serjeant contrary: A remainder upon an Eſtate tail is <hi>debile fundamentum,</hi> and cannot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold with aſſurance a Rent-charge againſt a common reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; and it cannot be found in any Book but in 5 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 2. That a remainder upon an Eſtate-tail expectant may be charged, for an Eſtate-tail is in Law preſumed to be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and therefore, what Lands are entailed by Fee, the words of the Fine are, <hi>Sibi &amp; haeredibus de Corpore ſuo exeuntibus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perpetuum.</hi> And it is the common learning in our Books that every Eſtate of Inheritance, be it Fee-ſimple or Fee-tail, ſhall be intended to be continued till the contrary be ſhewed. And the Authority which the Owner of a Remainder hath upon it is but conditional; <hi>ſcil</hi> If the Tenant in tail in poſſeſſion doth not countermand it by a recovery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And alſo the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon which the Avowry is made, is not the ſame poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which was charged, but is a Foreign poſſeſſion gained by the recovery, and therefore, before the proper poſſeſſion be recontinued, there can be no Diſtreſs nor Avowry, for the Land is not reduced in the privity of Eſtate which was charged; and if he in Reverſion upon ſuch Eſtate tail would
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:95367:81"/>
grant his reverſion rendring rent, and afterwards the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in tail in poſſeſſion ſuffers a common recovery, and dyeth without Iſſue; Now the reverſion being deſtroyed, the rent is gone. And he put this Caſe: Tenant in tail grants a Rent-charge to begin after his death without Iſſue, and afterwards ſuffers a common recovery, and dyes without Iſſue, it is a good rent, and ſhall bind the Recoveror &amp;c. At another day in the <hi>Exchequer Chamber,</hi> the Caſe was argued again by <hi>Snagg</hi> Serjeant for the Defendant; and he was very long in proving that a remainder might be charged, as in this caſe: But the Court diſcharged him of that, and directed him to argue to this Point, If this recovery did diſcharge the rent, &amp;c. wherefore he argued, That theſe common recoveries are falſe and feigned things, falſe in the Title, and covenous in the Proceedings, and all in prejudice of a third perſon. And <hi>Vide</hi> 14 <hi>H.</hi> 8.3. ſuch common recoveries are holden frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent, and therefore by fraud and covin being ſo odious in our Law, we ought not to give and allow unto them ſo much force as is due to unfeigned recoveries; for theſe common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries do not go in diſaffirmance of the former poſſeſſion, nor in any eviction of it, but for the moſt part in affirmance; and the Eſtate gained by this recovery is under the Eſtate of him againſt whom the recovery was had, and he is in by him; for common Recoveries are no other but common Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances: And in our Caſe the imagined Recompence cannot come to him who hath by the recovery loſt his rent, and therefore it is not reaſon that the recovery ſhould bind as to this rent. <hi>Vide</hi> 12 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 19, 20. Tenant in tail diſcontinueth, and takes back an Eſtate to him in Fee, and afterwards a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon recovery is had againſt him, it ſhall not bind the tail, for the preſumed recompence ſhall go to the Eſtate which he hath loſt, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the Eſtate in Fee, and not to the Eſtate tail, whereof at the time of the recovery he was ſeized: So in our Caſe, the Land which by Fiction of Law is to be yielded in value upon this Voucher, ſhall not extend to the benefit or recompence of the Grantee of the Rent-charge, but only to <hi>H.</hi> who hath loſt his remainder, and his new remainder, which comes in lieu of the former, ſhall not be charged with this rent: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the remainder, which by this recovery is drawn out of <hi>H. tranſit cum ſuo onere, &amp; cum acciderit</hi> ſhall anſwer, and ſhall yield the rent according to the purport of the Grant. As 33 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 4 <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. two Ioyntenants are, The one grants a Rent-charge, and afterwards releaſes to his Companion, he ſhall hold the Land charged, notwithſtanding that he be now fully in by the Feoffor. And if there be Lord and Tenant, and the Tenant grants a Rent-charge in Fee, and dyeth without Heir, ſo as the Land goes to the Lord in point of <hi>Eſcheat,</hi> yet the Lord ſhall hold the Land charged. And as to the Statute of <hi>Fraudulent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances,</hi>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:95367:82"/>
27 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 4. the ſame cannot extend to this Grant; for here, this Grant is upon conſideration of Nature made to his own Son for his advancement. <hi>Popham</hi> Attorney General to the contrary: And that neither the Grantee of this Rent, nor he who makes Conuſans in his right ſhall falſifie this recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And he put a difference where the party who leaſeth or charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a remainder, is bound by the recovery voluntarily, and where involuntarily; for where the recovery is ſuffered voluntarily, there the Grantee or Leſſee ſhall not be bound by that recovery, but they ſhall falſifie: But where as our Caſe is, there the Party who chargeth or leaſeth is bound involuntarily by ſuch recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, there all Intereſts are bound, and the charge is ſubject to the ſame miſchief as the remainder it ſelf, out of which it is iſſuing, <hi>Vide</hi> 7 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 12. He in the remainder in Fee ſhall not ſatisfie a recovery had againſt the Tenant for life, but he is put to his Writ of Entry, <hi>ad terminum qui praeteriit,</hi> in which he ſhall fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifie, and not by Entry, much leſs he in the remainder upon an Eſtate tail ſhall not falſifie; and falſifier lyes properly where the Party who grants or leaſeth againſt his Grant or Leaſe, practiſeth by ſuch recovery to avoid or defeat his own Eſtate, and by conſequence the Intereſt of his Grantee or Leſſee: But in our Caſe there is not any ſuch matter; for the Grantor <hi>H.</hi> was not party or privy to this recovery, nor Tenant, nor Vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chee, and therefore no Covin, and then no Voucher; and all the Caſes in our Law of falſifying of recoveries are upon ſuch matter. And he put the Caſe of 19 <hi>E.</hi> 2. <hi>Fitz. Title Aſſiſe</hi> 82. where the Conuſee of a Statute Merchant, having ſued Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, one who had no right impleaded the Conuſor, and by Covin recovered againſt him, and by Execution upon that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery ouſted the Conuſee, it was holden he ſhould have an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſe and falſifie; for here he who party to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery: Donee in tail, the remainder over in Fee upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuffers a common recovery, the Condition is gone. And as to the Statute of 21 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 15. Falſifying is not given in our Caſe by the ſaid Statute, the words of which are, <hi>Where divers Men have leaſed their Land to Farm, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, after ſuch Leaſes made, the Leſſors, their Heirs and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns have ſuffered Recoveries:</hi> Within which words our Caſe is not; for he againſt whom the recovery was had was not our Grantor, his Heir or Aſſign: So if there be Tenant in tail, the remainder over to another in Fee, he in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder makes a Leaſe for years, and afterwards Tenant in tail in poſſeſſion ſuffers a common recovery, the Leſſee ſhall not falſifie; for that Leaſe was not made by him againſt whom the recovery was had. And it is clear, that by the Common Law, the Grantee of a Rent-charge cannot falſifie againſt the Grantor, his Heirs or Aſſigns: But it was a doubt as it appeareth. 7 <hi>H.</hi> 7.11. If upon a faint pleader, the Leſſee
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:95367:82"/>
for years might be received, for the Statute of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends but to default or re-diſſeiſin; but now by the Statute of 21 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. in three Caſes, Default, Reddition, and Faint pleading, ſuch Reſceipt lyes, which proves that in caſe of rent, as the Statute of 11 <hi>H.</hi> 8. hath ordained in caſe of a Leaſe for years, where the Leſſor, his Heirs or Aſſigns, have ſuffered the recovery and not otherwiſe. And afterwards he argued very much upon the reputation and dignity of common Recoveries, that they are the ſtrongeſt and moſt effectual Aſſurances in the Law, and therefore they ought to be countenanced rather by the Iudges, than in any part diminiſhed or diſabled, and we ought to conſider of them <hi>Non ex rigore juris, rigida diſquiſitione,</hi> but according to the common uſe and practice, what is the ground and foundation of theſe Recoveries: And ſo Iudges have uſed heretofore to examine Matters, which peradventure, according to the ſtrict Rules of the Common Law, drew them away. But they perceiving that a dangerous Conſequence thereby would follow to an infinite number of the Kings Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the Law having been otherwiſe practiſed before have fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their Iudgments, not according to the exact Rules of Law, but to avoid the Inconvenience aforeſaid according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and received practice, &amp;c. <hi>Nam communis Error facit jus;</hi> and to that purpoſe he cited a Caſe very lately adjudged in <hi>B.R. viz.</hi> A Writ of Error was brought in <hi>B.

That his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors grant a Rent-charge to one in Fee out of his ſaid Lands, by that Deviſe the Executors have a Fee-ſimple in the Land, otherwiſe they could not make ſuch a Grant: So here in the Caſe in queſtion: and alſo by the ſame reaſon the Executors have a Fee-ſimple in the Land, for otherwiſe they could not grant a Rent in Fee, nor the Land to the <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapter</hi> in Fee, by which the <hi>Chaplain</hi> in perpetuity ought to be found: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though but one <hi>Chauntry</hi> was erected where three were intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the Land deviſed was not ſufficient for all three, ſo that now by the erecting of one <hi>Chauntry</hi> only, the Executors perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the truſt as near to the intent of the Deviſor as it could be, and as the Land deviſed might extend unto; it is not material, if here be a Condition, or a Confidence in the words of the Grant to the <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapter ad inveniendum, &amp;c.</hi> for if it be a Condition, and broken, no advantage ſhall be taken of it, for it is out of the Statute; and if it be a Confidence, then it is performed as near the intent of the Deviſor as it might be, and the Condition being performed, although not exactly, yet ſo near as it may be, it is well enough performed: As a Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon Condition, that the Feoffee ſhall make a Gift in tail to Husband and Wife, and the Heirs of the Body of the Husband, the Husband dyeth, now the Gift cannot be <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do &amp; forma,</hi> and therefore if it be, it may be, <hi>ſcil.</hi> as near the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the parties as it may be, it is good; and therefore if the Land be given to the wife for life without impeachment of waſte, the remainder over, it is ſufficient in caſe of a Truſt and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. <hi>1.</hi> It was moved, If here be any <hi>Chauntry</hi> in the Caſe: And a <hi>Chauntry</hi> is nothing elſe but a Suſtentation for a <hi>Prieſt</hi> that chaunts in a place certain for the Souls of the dead:

And <hi>Chauntries</hi> are in two ſorts; the one incorporated, as by the King by his Letters Patents; the other not incorporated, as our caſe is: And truly the greateſt number of <hi>Chauntries</hi> were not corporal, but were <hi>Chauntries</hi> but in reputation, and not <hi>Revera;</hi> but yet ſuch <hi>Chauntries</hi> in reputation are within the Statute, which ſee by the words of it, <hi>accepted, taken or reputed,</hi> as Part or Member of any <hi>Chauntry.</hi> It hath been Objected, That nothing paſſeth to the King by that Statute, but that which is parcel or belonging to the <hi>Chauntry</hi> but this Land is not parcel nor belonging to any <hi>Chauntry,</hi> for all the Land is in the <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapter.</hi> As to that, we ought to have regard unto the intent of the Deviſor, which was to make the Land a <hi>Chauntry:</hi> And ſo in the time of <hi>Hen. 8.</hi> it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torned in the <hi>Exchequer</hi> for the Firſt-fruits of the <hi>Chauntry</hi> of <hi>Hen.

And when the intent of the Deviſor may ſtand with the act of the Executors, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue, That the Land ſhall make the <hi>Chauntry</hi> according to the intent of the Deviſor; for the Executors have given all the Land to the <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapter</hi> to find a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and things belonging to a <hi>Chauntry;</hi> and the Executors have given the ſaid Land to the ſaid intent, and the aſſignment of the ſpecial portion out of it, is but a ſhewing how the profits of the Lands ſhall be beſtowed: For I conceive, That the Land at the time of the diſpoſition aforeſaid, was not of any better value, than it was appointed to be imployed as aforeſaid; and if the <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapter</hi> by their induſtry have made and improved it to a greater value, they ſhall take advantage thereof till it be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the King by the Statute, and it ſhall not be ſaid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a Rent, but rather a portion of the profits, &amp;c. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Land ſhall be ſaid the <hi>Chauntry,</hi> and not the Sum; and here the intent of the Statute extends to the intent of the Founder: So that if the intent of the Founder was to give the Land to Superſtitious Vſes, the ſame is within the Statute: If <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> wills that his Feoffees have the profits of his Lands <hi>ut ſupra,</hi> to the Suſtentation of a <hi>Chauntry Prieſt,</hi> and the Feoffees imploy but <hi>20 l. per Annum,</hi> whereas the Land is of the value of <hi>100 l. per Annum,</hi> by this Statute the King ſhall have all; for the intent of the Founder was, That all ſhould be imployed: And ſo here; for upon the Matter, the <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapter</hi> are but as Feoffees; and ſee that this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>Chauntries</hi> makes a great difference between <hi>Obits</hi> and <hi>Lights,</hi> and <hi>Chauntries;</hi> for in the Caſe of <hi>Obits</hi> and <hi>Lights,</hi> the King ſhall not have but that which was imployed. <hi>Whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones</hi> Caſe was, That <hi>Whetſtone</hi> ſeized of the Manor of

Waſte is aſſigned in the breaking <hi>de uno muro lapideo;</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant pleaded the licence of the Plaintiff to break it, and upon that they were at Iſſue: And he ſaid, If the leſſor cutteth trees, upon which the leſſee brings an Action of Treſpaſs he ſhall not recover damages according to the value of the trees cut down; but for the Treſpaſs to the Soil, and for the loſs of the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and the Acorns, &amp;c. and if the leſſee cutteth down trees, the leſſor cannot take them, becauſe he hath other remedy.

At another day it was argued by <hi>Shuttleworth</hi> Serjeant, and exception taken, becauſe it is too general, <hi>ſcil. Quod fecit vaſtum in terris quas Sir R.

although there was not any ſuch Writ in the Regiſter. <hi>Fenner</hi> and <hi>Walmſley</hi> contrary; for there is not any ſuch form in the Regiſter, <hi>Cujus haeredes de corpore, &amp;c.</hi> and we are not to deviſe a new form in this caſe, but it is ſufficient to ſhew the ſpecial matter in the Count; alſo the words in the Writ are true, for the Plaintiffs are Heirs to Sir <hi>R.

And the Court awarded the Writ good, and ſaid that the caſe is not like the caſe in <hi>Fitz. N.

Another Exception was taken to the Count, That where the two Defendants were Tenants in Common of the ſaid Lands demiſed, the Writ is <hi>tenuerunt,</hi> which is intended a Ioynt-tenure. But this Exception was not allowed: And <hi>Vide</hi> 44 <hi>E.</hi> 3. in Waſte the Plaintiff counted upon divers Leaſes, and <hi>Fitz. N.

But that Exception for the Tenant by the Curteſie joyns to no purpoſe; for he is not to have Damages, becauſe the Waſte was not to his diſinhereſin, and the Land he ſhall not recover againſt the Defendant for the Term is not determined; and ſuch was the Opinion of the Court.

                  </gap>aw, <hi>Shuttleworth</hi> ſaid, That the Action of Waſte ought to be brought againſt the Leſſee himſelf, and not againſt the Aſſignee for when he grants over his Term, excepting the Trees, it is a good Exception; for when the Land upon which the Trees grow is leaſed to another, the Trees paſs by the Leaſe as well as the Land, and the property of them is in the Leſſee during the Term; by which when he grants his Land, he may well except them, as the firſt Leſſor might have done; and if the Leſſee for years cutteth down the Trees, the Leſſor cannot take them for that he hath other ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient remedy, <hi>ſcil</hi> an Action of Waſte. <hi>Fenner</hi> and <hi>Walmſley</hi> contrary: And they conceived that the Leſſee had but a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Property in the Trees, <hi>ſcil.</hi> for <hi>Fire-bote, Plough bote, Houſe-bote, &amp;c.</hi> But if he demiſeth the Land, or granteth his Intereſt in it, he cannot except the Trees, nor his ſpecial Property in them no more than he who hath Common appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant may grant the Land, excepting the Common: And in ſuch
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:95367:87"/>
caſe, the general Property in the Trees remains in the Leſſor, as parcel of his Inheritance. And this appeareth by many caſes: 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 13. Leſſee for life and he in the remainder joyn in a leaſe for life, the Leſſee commits Waſte, the Tenant for life, and he in the remainder, joyn in an Action of Waſte, the Tenant for life ſhall recover the place waſted, and he in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion all the damages. <hi>Vide</hi> 2 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. cited before, That the Leſſor may licence the Leſſee to cut the Trees, which proves that the Property is in him. And <hi>Vide</hi> 40 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 22. the Leſſor ſhall have the Windfalls. And as to that which hath been ſaid, That by the Exception of the Trees, the Soil it ſelf is alſo excepted that is true, as to the Trees for nouriſhment, and not otherwiſe; for if the Leſſor cutteth down the Trees, or roots them up he ſhall not after meddle with the Land where &amp;c. but the Soil ſhall be entirely to the Leſſee: The Leſſor during the Term may grant the Trees, ſo cannot the Leſſee; therefore the greater and better Property in the Trees is in the Leſſor and not in the Leſſee, and the Trees <hi>proprie lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quendo,</hi> are not parcel of the thing demiſed. If this Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Trees or Woods ſhould hold place, Inconvenience would follow; for as it is holden in 15 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 11. If the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor of Wood commits Waſte in one corner of the Wood, he ſhould not loſe all the Wood, but that place only: But if in the ſaid Wood there are divers Plats of Land in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Wood, if the Termor commits Waſte in that Wood he ſhall loſe all the ſaid Plats, although he hath not done waſte in them, for they are parcel of the Wood. <hi>Vide Temps E.</hi> 1. <hi>Fitz.

               <p>THe Caſe of Sir <hi>Francis Englefield</hi> was argued by <hi>Popham;</hi> and he ſaid, That this Condition was not ſuch a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Condition, or ſo running in privity, but that it might be transferred by <hi>33 H. 8.</hi> or <hi>29 Eliz.</hi> to the Queen; for although that the conſideration which moved and induced Sir <hi>Francis</hi> to create the Condition be private and particular, yet that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Condition it ſelf is general; for the private cauſe of the Condition doth not make the Condition private, but as in other Caſes, and he put the Caſes before of Ranſom: But if the Condition had been conceived in theſe Terms, <hi>ſcil.</hi> If my Nephew ſhall be given to intollerable Vices, then if I ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, &amp;c. there it had been otherwiſe. <hi>Vide</hi> the Statute of <hi>33 H. 8. cap. 20.</hi> by which it is enacted, That if any Subject is attaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of High Treaſon by the courſe of the Common Law, the King by ſuch Attainder ſhall have ſuch benefit and advantage as well of Vſes, Rights, Entries, Conditions, &amp;c. as of Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, Reverſions, &amp;c. as if it had been done and declared by Authority of Parliament, that is as much as to ſay, as if the Condition in its proper terms had been given to the King by Act of Parliament, &amp;c. and vouched <hi>Dacres</hi> caſe <hi>17 Eliz.</hi> cited by him before, where, upon a Grant of all his Goods and Chattels revokable upon tender of <hi>5 s.</hi> it was reſolved, That ſuch a Condition was given to the King, and by ſpecial Grace
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:95367:90"/>
of the Queen Sir <hi>Tho. Gorge</hi> had the benefit of it: And here, although the cauſe of the <hi>Proviſo</hi> be private and ſpecial, yet the Condition is not tyed in the cauſe, and the Statute gives to the Queen all Conditions which are uſual, and for the benefit of the Queen; and at the time of the making of this Statute ſuch Conditions were uſual, <hi>&amp; tunc temporis,</hi> the Condition was pen'd, not by way of re-entry, but that the uſe ſhould be void; and that ſuch Conditions were uſual at the time of the making of the Statute of <hi>29 Eliz.</hi> appeareth by the Statute made two years before, <hi>ſcil. 27 Eliz.</hi> for the repreſſing of fraudulent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances: By which it is provided by an expreſs branch of it againſt ſuch Conditions containing power of Revocation; and Laws are for the moſt part made to give order for things which may happen: And I conceive, That this tender for the Queen is well enough for the time, notwithſtanding all the terms are paſt, yet the two years are not incurred: I covenant within a year to ſuffer a common Recovery, all the terms are paſt without any Recovery ſuffered, yet no Action lyeth upon that covenant before the year be fully expired, although that the terms be paſt, it being impoſſible to ſuffer a Recovery within the time prefixed: <hi>A.</hi> covenants with <hi>B.</hi> in conſideration of Marriage to ſuffer a Recovery before the Feaſt of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> and if <hi>A.</hi> before the ſaid Feaſt doth not ſuffer ſuch Recovery, that then he ſhall be ſeized to the uſe of <hi>C.

Dyer.</hi> The King leaſed the Manor of <hi>D.</hi> for years to <hi>A.</hi> upon condition, that if the King at any time during the term ſhall make a Leaſe to the ſaid <hi>A.</hi> of the Manor of <hi>S.</hi> for life, then the Leaſe for years ſhall ceaſe and be void; the King makes the Leaſe for life, the leaſe for years is void without any Office, for the Leaſe for life is upon record: The caſe of <hi>Auditor, 3 Eliz.

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:95367:90"/>
the Office of Remembrancer by acceptance of the Baron ſhall bind in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> void without a <hi>Scire Facias</hi> or Office. <hi>Vide etiam Dyer (5 Ma. 159.)</hi> he being Iuſtice of the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> was made Iuſtice of the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> his firſt Office was gone and determined: Alſo he ſaid, That the Condition (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing performed <hi>ut ſupra) ſua vi &amp; virtute,</hi> without any Office ſhall make void the Conveyance to which it was annexed. And if Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> being attainted, had tendred the King, <hi>ipſo facto</hi> as it worked to him, ſo <hi>ipſo facto</hi> it ſhould work to the Queen. When the Act of <hi>29 Eliz.</hi> had made the Aſſurance void, the Land is in the Queen preſently, by means of Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> to whom the Land returned, and from him in the ſame inſtant veſted in the Queen. <hi>Cook</hi> to the contrary: The Condition is not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Queen: Words make the Plea; therefore the words of the Condition are to be conſidered, in which it is to be ſeen if this Condition be annexed to the privity of Nature, or be general. The Form of the Condition is, Sir <hi>Francis</hi> being a man of great Living, and having a great Manor of his own Name, in conſideration of the preſervation of his Name and Blood, &amp;c. covenanted to ſtand ſeized, &amp;c. And further, <hi>pro eo quod,</hi> his ſaid Nephew was of tender age, and his proof could not now appear, and it might be that in time to come he might be given to intolerable Vices; therefore the ſaid Sir <hi>Francis</hi> did not think it convenient to ſettle the ſaid Inheritance in his ſaid Nephew abſolutely without a bridle to reſtrain him, therefore it was provided, That if the Vncle delivered a King of Gold to his Nephew, to the intent to make void, &amp;c. And this is a ſpecial Condition, private and peculiar to the perſon of Sir <hi>Francis</hi> incident to him, and to no other, and incommunicable; and therefore it is not given to the Queen: But ſuch Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which the Heir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lord by Eſcheat, or Executors may have, the Queen ſhall have by the Statute <hi>10 H. 7. 18.</hi> Leſſee for years of a Houſe covenants to repair it within ſix years, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in which term he dyeth, no reparation being made, covenant lyeth againſt the Executors; contrary if the covenant had been that he ſhould repair during his life. It hath been ſaid, That the things which are matters of privity are the conſiderations which cauſed Sir <hi>Francis</hi> to make this <hi>Proviſo,</hi> but they are not any part of the condition or <hi>Proviſo:</hi> Truly the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration raiſes the uſe, and precedes the <hi>Proviſo</hi> which is tyed to the conſideration with an <hi>Ideo,</hi> and all is but one Sentence knit together with the <hi>Ideo.</hi> And although conſideration of Blood be not parcel of the <hi>Proviſo,</hi> yet that which follows is, <hi>ſcil.</hi> for that his Nephew, &amp;c. And in this Conveyance Sir <hi>Francis praeſtitit utrumque munus Nutricis, ubera, &amp; verbera.</hi> And Acts of Parliament do not give away things knit to Nature, by the general words <hi>All things. Vide</hi> the Lord <hi>Brays</hi> caſe, <hi>2 Eliz. Dyer 90.</hi> The Father having the Wardſhip of his Son and Heir ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:95367:91"/>
if he Outlawed ſhall not forfeit the ſame, for it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable to him, notwithſtanding that the Land be holden of the Queen, and ſo Nature cannot be transferred, therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this <hi>Proviſo.</hi> And ſo is the Tenure of Frankalmoigne <hi>35 H. 6. 58.</hi> and it ſhould be a great rigour to take the bridle out of the hands of the Natural Vncle, into the hands of Iuſtice, which is <hi>Manus regia:</hi> And he cited the Caſe of the Lord <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> where it was rul'd, That where the Act of Attainder of <hi>Norris</hi> gave to the King all Rights, Titles, &amp;c. yet a Writ of <hi>Error</hi> was not given thereby. (<hi>Manwood,</hi> Actions are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly given by the ſaid Act of Attainder.) As to the ſecond point, I conceive that the Coveyance is become void when the terms within the two years are paſſed, and ſhall not expect until the two years be expired, for the Inrollment ought to be within the term; ſo that if all the terms of the two years be paſt it is now impoſſible for to inroll the Deed within the time limited by the Statute, and then, by <hi>29 H. 8</hi> the Conveyance is void, and then is the Queen ſeized in Fee at the time of the making of the Leaſe by the Attainder of Sir <hi>Francis:</hi> As to the Certificate, without Office it is not ſufficient to entitle the Queen to the Land; and I deny the difference put by <hi>Popham</hi> between a Condition to be performed on the part of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentee, and on the part of the King: I confeſs that a Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to inform the Queen, or her Councel, of the quantity, quality, value, &amp;c. of the Land, is good without Office, but not to entitle the Queen <hi>de novo</hi> to the Inheritance of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; I grant that the Commiſſion is of Record, but the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the King is matter <hi>in pais,</hi> and not of Record. Three things ought to be obſerved in every Certificate, to make it a good and lawful Certificate according to the courſe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, unleſs it be in caſes of neceſſity, as in caſe of <hi>Ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter le mere, &amp;c. 1.</hi> It ought not to be in the abſence of the party. <hi>2.</hi> It ought to be <hi>pendente placito convocatis in ea parte convocandis. 3.</hi> It ought to be directed to a known Officer; but a thing certified by a private perſon, being no Officer, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be good. Alſo a Certificate according to the courſe of the common Law, being good, is not traverſable. At another day, the Caſe was argued by <hi>Egerton</hi> Solicitor for the Queen: The Condition is given to the Queen by <hi>33 H. 8.</hi> and alſo by <hi>29 Eliz.</hi> and this Condition in it ſelf is a general and ordinary Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and reſts not in privity, and ſuch an Act as may be made by any ſtranger as well as by Sir <hi>Francis</hi> himſelf, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the tender of the King. The reaſons which moved Sir <hi>Francis</hi> to knit this Condition to the Conveyance were natural, but the <hi>Proviſo</hi> and the performance of it not tryed to Nature, and therefore all the caſes of privity are here out of Seiſin. As to the Lord <hi>Brays</hi> Caſe, the ſame was not any Wardſhip, but only an Order for the government or his Son and Heir; for the Wardſhip of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:95367:91"/>
the Father in the Son is not a Chattel in him. As to the Caſe of the Lord <hi>Norris,</hi> the Writ of Error could not accrue to the Queen, for by the Act of Attainder no Actions were given to the King: And here is not any ſuch privity as hath been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, for by the words of the <hi>Proviſo</hi> the Ring might be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to his Executors or Adminiſtrators, therefore the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might be tendred when he is dead, therefore without pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. Title for alienation in Mortmain of Lands purchaſed by a Villain of the King, or for a Condition broken, are not in the King before Office: But here the Condition is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed on the part of the Queen, which her Royal Majeſty cannot perform, and therefore Commiſſioners are appointed to do it, which they have done, and upon the Commiſſion retorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, have informed the Queen of all the performance of it, and all is now upon Record. And there is a great difference between Certificates, as in our caſe, and Certificates which have been cited on the other ſide, which are uſed to make Tryals upon Iſſues joyned betwixt party and party, and in ſuch Certificates I confeſs the Law, as <hi>Cook</hi> hath argued: The Sheriff is not known to be ſuch an Officer, but by his Commiſſion under the Great Seal, he upon a Writ of the King to him directed, Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Diſſeiſins, Attaches, &amp;c. theſe are matters <hi>in fait;</hi> but when the Sheriff hath retorned his Service, then it is become matter of Record: So in our caſe, the retorn of the tender, &amp;c. where the Queen is to be informed of the Lands of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which ſhe is to have, there ought to be an Office; but here the Queen is to do an act, and that ſhe hath done under the Great Seal by Commiſſion, by the Retorn of which ſhe is in the whole matter, therefore there needs not an Office to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form her of that which ſhe her ſelf hath done by another Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized by her to do it: And he ſaid that the Leaſes made by the Queen, being Tenant <hi>pur auter vie,</hi> were not void <hi>ab initio,</hi> but from the time of the two years, but now the Eſtate of the Queen for life is determined, therefore alſo the Leaſes derived out of it. Exception hath been taken to the Information, <hi>ſcil.

Eliz.</hi> this Caſe was argued by the <hi>Barons. Clark puiſne Baron</hi> ſaid, That Iudgment ought to be given for the Queen. And firſt he ſaid, I conceive that here upon this Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is no uſe created in Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> for he ſhall pay for a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of Alienation if the Lands be holden in chief; and they themſelves in pleading the uſes, ſay <hi>Virtute cujus</hi> the ſaid Sir <hi>Francis</hi> was ſeized in his Demeſne as of Freehold for his life the remainder thereof, &amp;c. Although this Condition be tyed to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and reſts in privity, as hath been objected and ſo inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet by Act of Parliament it may be transferred.

As to the Exception to the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>ſcil. Per Indenturam ſuam,</hi> without ſaying <hi>Sigillo ſuo ſigillat';</hi> for if the Indenture was not Sealed, then it was not any Deed, and then no Covenant, and then no Vſe, and then no Condition, &amp;c. But I conceive, That the Information is good enough, for Covenants by Indenture include Sealing and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery, and other things which are of the Eſſence of an Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which need not to be pleaded, becauſe in Law preſumed: But for a clear Anſwer to it, Sealing and Delivery are matters <hi>in pais,</hi> therefore confeſſed by the Demurrer: And here the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants have pleaded <hi>Quod bene &amp; verum eſt,</hi> That the ſaid Sir <hi>Francis</hi> by the ſaid Indenture, &amp;c. covenanted, &amp;c. and if any imperfection be in the pleading, it is now ſaved by the Demurrer. An Exception hath been taken to the bar, becauſe the Defendants have pleaded three ſeveral Leaſes of ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of the Lands in queſtion, and concluded, <hi>Virtute quarum qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem conceſſionum,</hi> they were poſſeſſed and entred, &amp;c. which cannot be good, becauſe ſeveral Intereſts and Eſtates, but ought to have pleaded ſeverally, <hi>ſcil.</hi> One Leaſe of ſuch Land in which the Intruſion is ſuppoſed, and ſo concluded <hi>Virtute cujus.</hi> they were poſſeſſed, <hi>&amp; ſic de caeteris.</hi> and ſo to each Intereſt one ſeveral Concluſion: <hi>A.</hi> hath an Annual Rent of <hi>10 l.</hi> out of <hi>Bl.

Acre</hi> aforeſaid, and avows for all the Rents together, the Avowry is not good, for how can the Avowant have a Retorn? when <hi>Non conſtat Curiae,</hi> how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Cattel he took for one Rent, and how many for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: As to the matter in Law, firſt, If this Condition doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the Eſtate of Sir <hi>Francis, Nihil habet quaeſtionis;</hi> for by
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:95367:93"/>
the performance of the Condition Sir <hi>Francis</hi> is <hi>in ſtatu quo prius,</hi> and ſo all the Eſtates limited by the ſaid Indenture quite plucked up by the root. As to the Condition, I conceive that it is not knit in privity to Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> and doth not depend upon his liking or diſliking: The Act it ſelf, in which is the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the Condition, doth conſiſt in the tender of the Ring, the words preceding purporting the doubt of the proof of his Son, and the bridle, &amp;c. are his Motives by which he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to make the Condition, not to perform the Condition. nor any part or parcel of the Condition, or word of Condition. The words of the Condition are, If he himſelf, or any other by his appointment ſhall tender, &amp;c. What privity is here? who knows who ſhall be his Deputy to make the tender? It may be any perſon in the World, therefore no privity in the perſon who is to tender; and as to the perſon to whom the tender is to be made, there is no privity there, for it may be made to the Nephew, his Executors or Adminiſtrators. Alſo no preciſe place is ſet down in the Condition where the tender ſhall be, it may be in <hi>Ireland, Scotland,</hi> or in any other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, therefore the Condition in all points general, and ſo free as an ordinary Condition: But if the Condition was to be performed by Sir <hi>Francis</hi> in his proper perſon, or by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing his name with his hand, or ſuch like act, then it had been otherwiſe. The caſe of <hi>Littleton 76.</hi> A Feoffment in Fee is made upon Condition, that if the Feoffee pay to the Feoffor ſuch a day <hi>10 l.</hi> then the Feoffee ſhall have the Land to him and his Heirs for ever, and before the day the Feoffee makes a Feoffment over upon a Condition, the ſecond Feoffee tenders the Mony, it is a good tender, and yet the words of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition do not extend ſo far, but only to the firſt Feoffee, who was privy to the Condition; ſo where the payment is to be made on the part of the Feoffor, and he dyes before the day, tender by the Heir is good; and here, this is a general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and therefore may be performed generally without being reſtrained to any perſon for the performance of it: And here, we are in an Act of Parliament, <hi>Quod omnia poteſt, 32 H. 8.</hi> gave to Aſſigns of the Reverſion which always before were fixed in privity. <hi>Monks</hi> dead perſons in Law, by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament made capable of Purchaſe and Inheritance; <hi>Gavelkind</hi> and <hi>Borough-Engliſh</hi> made diſcendable at the common Law, which the King could not do: An <hi>Alien</hi> born is made Denizen by the King, by which he may Purchaſe, but yet not inherit: But an Act of Parliament may make him heritable; Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Blood the King cannot take off, but it ought to be purged by Act of Parliament. As to the Statute of <hi>29 Eliz.</hi> it hath made the Conveyance void, as hath been objected; for the Terms within the two years limited by the Statute are paſt, and then the Condition is gone, as againſt Intail upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:95367:93"/>
if the Intail be ſpent the Condition is gone: But I conceive, that until the two years be fully expired, the Eſtates limited by the Conveyance continue, and the Condition alſo. The words of the ſaid Statute are, <hi>(Shall within two years after the laſt day of this Seſſion, &amp;c. openly ſhew and bring forth into the Queens Court of <hi>Exchequer,</hi> his Conveyance, and there in the Term time in open Court, ſhall offer and exhibit the ſame;)</hi> Theſe words ſhew that the parties ought to ſhew the Conveyance within two years, but doth not ſpeak of any term and in the other Clauſe it ſpeaks of term, but not of two years; ſo the time in which it ought to be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is two years, but the time of the Inrollment might be in the term after the two years well enough; for there are two two times in the Statute, the one to ſhew the Conveyance, the other for the Inrollment of it, and two things are to be done, <hi>Shewing</hi> and <hi>Inrollment,</hi> and two times anſwerable to them, two years, and Term-time. And he took it for a general Rule, that time once expreſſed, ſhall not be afterwards by implica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion abridged. And if by your conſtruction you make the time to end with the Term, you abridge the time by a Month at leaſt, which was expreſſed before, two years. And for the reaſonable conſtruction of times, <hi>Vide 28 H. 8. Dyer 44 Boulds</hi> Caſe. If it fortune <hi>Joan Moll'</hi> to deceaſe before the Feaſt of &amp;c. without Iſſue Male of her Body then living, &amp;c. this word <hi>(then)</hi> ſhall be referred to the Feaſt, and not to the time of the death of the party; for (as the reaſon of the Caſe is) where the intent of the parties is to have continuance in the thing, the thing which they would have continue to the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream time as may be: And if Lands be given to one and the Heirs Males of his Body begotten, and if he dye with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Heirs of his Body, then it ſhall remain over; by this Implication (if he dyes without Heirs of his Body) the Donee ſhall not have general Tail, but it ſhall be intended ſuch Heirs to whom it was limited before. And in our Caſe here, there are ſome weeks between the ends of the Terms, and the end of the two years, and thoſe weeks ſhall not be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly void, for in theſe weeks after the end of the Terms thoſe of the <hi>Chancery</hi> ſhall take Conuſance of Deeds: And here in our Caſe, the party was only to ſhew the Deed, which might have been done at any time after the Terms, ſo as it be within the two years; if one be bound with Condition, That if within two years he pay the Queens Silver upon a Fine to be levied, and then and there in Term time ingroſs the ſame, if he pay the Queens Silver within the two years, he hath ſaved his Bond, although that the Fine be not ingroſſed until a Term after the two years: So if one be bound to acknowledge a Deed in the <hi>Chancery</hi> within two years, and there in the Term-time to Inroll the ſame, if he do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:95367:94"/>
it within two years, it is ſufficient, and he may inroll it afterwards: So in our Caſe, the Eſtates continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Condition alſo till the two years are fully expired, therefore the Condition is well performed; for the Eſtate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues defeazable by the Condition, becauſe within the two years, and to abridge time is a violent thing. And now Sir <hi>Francis</hi> is alive, ſo as the power of the tender of the power of the King continueth: And I conceive, That the Certificate is ſufficent without any Office, and the party grieved may have traverſe to it: And I hold clearly, that as this Caſe is Office cannot be found. Office properly is to be found of things <hi>in pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And now for concluſion; The Queen comes in paramount her firſt Eſtate which ſhe had <hi>pur auter voy, ſcil.</hi> by Attainder, and now ſhe hath it by the Condition, and ſo paramount the Title under which the Defendants claim: And afterwards Iudgment was given for the Queen.</p>

But that Exception was now allowed: For it was holden that the Livery in the Manor was good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and ſo the Letter of Attorney ſufficient; for in all Deeds of Feoffments in which Letters of Attorney are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, the Livery of the Deed is to the Feoffee only and no mention made of any delivery to the Attorney, for by ſuch Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Attorney no Intereſt is to paſs, but only an Authority. And note, It was reſolved by all the Iuſtices, That in the computation of theſe three Months there ought to be allowed to every Month <hi>28</hi> days: And now we are to ſee if this Rent be well demanded, becauſe the demand was made an hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sun-ſetting, and then the party went out, and walked in the Lane till the ſetting of the Sun, without any other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: And it was moved that this walking in the Lane, which was not a common High-way, but a private way, and that the Houſe of the ſaid Farm was of the one ſide of the Lane, and the Farm-land on the other, and ſo the Land parcel of the Farm, and then his walking there is a continuance of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; <hi>quod <hi>Catlin</hi> conceſſir,</hi> was the Lane a High-way, or not, for the Manor is on both ſide. And it was agreed by all the Iuſtices, That if the Leſſor cometh to the Land before the laſt hour, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Morning, or in the Afternoon, and demands the Rent, and afterwards goes off the Land, and is not there at the laſt inſtant of the day, the ſame is not a ſufficient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, although that return be preſently after the Sun is ſet: And by <hi>Gerrard</hi> Attorney General, If the Leſſor cometh upon the Land at the laſt day before the laſt inſtant, as in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. and demands the Rent, and continues there upon the Land till the Sun be ſet, without making any other demand, yet the demand for the Manor is good enough, for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence there is the continuance of the demand, <hi>Quod fuit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſum per totam Curiam.</hi> And by <hi>Catlin,</hi> If the Leſſor after his demand in the Morning departeth off the Land, and before the laſt inſtant returneth, and ſtays upon the Land till Sun-ſetting, there is the continuance of a demand, without any further demand, which <hi>Wray</hi> Chief Iuſtice <hi>conceſſit.</hi> And it was holden in this caſe, That where <hi>R.</hi> left his Servant in

the Houſe to ſtay there, and to ſignifie to him that if any perſon came to pay the Rent, that that was not any continuance of the demand, for <hi>R.</hi> himſelf was but a Servant, and he in that buſineſs could not make a Servant: And <hi>Catline</hi> ſaid, That the Biſhop himſelf might by word command his Servant to demand a Rent, and to make a Re-entry, <hi>Quod fuit conceſſum,</hi> but in our Caſe <hi>R.</hi> had not commanded his Servant to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny demand: And ſo here upon the whole matter is not any ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient demand; and ſo <hi>Wray</hi> Chief Iuſtice ſaid.</p>

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:95367:96"/>
but only Bayliffs: And the Statute ordains, That upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizance Proceſs ſhall go to the Sheriffs, &amp;c. therefore not to them. But the whole Court was clear to the contrary; for we well know, that they of <hi>London</hi> have a Court of Record, and every Court of Record hath authority incident to it to take Recognizances for all things which do concern the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction of that Court, and which ariſe by reaſon of the matters there depending. Another matter was Objected, for that the Recognizance was taken <hi>in interiori Camera,</hi> but the Court was holden <hi>in exteriori Camera,</hi> therefore it was not well taken. But as to that <hi>Anderſon</hi> Chief Iuſtice ſaid, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that the Recognizance was not well taken, yet becauſe that in a <hi>Scire Facias</hi> ſued upon it, the Defendant ſhall not take any advantage, he ſhall be now bound by that admittance: As if one ſues a <hi>Scire Facias,</hi> as upon a Recognizance, whereas in truth there is not any ſuch Recognizance, and the party pleads admitting ſuch Record, and thereupon Iudgment is given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, the ſame is not void, but voidable.

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:95367:102"/>

upon Ioyntenancy pleaded by Fine, the Writ ought to abate without any Averment by the Demandant againſt it; the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment hath been received againſt the Law: And by <hi>Southcote</hi> at the common Law, If the Tenant plead Ioyntenancy by Deed, the Writ ſhould abate without any Averment, but that was remedied by the Statute of 34 <hi>E.</hi> 1. but Ioyntenancy by Fine doth remain as it was by the common Law; for he hath puniſhment enough in that, becauſe by that Plea, if it be falſe, he hath by way of concluſion given away the Moiety of the Land in demand to him with whom he hath pleaded Ioyntenancy; and the Law doth not intend that he will ſo ſlightly depart with his Land for the abatement of a Writ: Elſe in a <hi>Praecipe quod reddat</hi> the Tenant confeſſeth himſelf to be Villain to a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the Writ ſhall abate, without any Averment of Frank-eſtate; for the Law intends that the Tenant will not enthrawl himſelf without cauſe. <hi>Wray</hi> to the ſame intent: But the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant may confeſs and avoid the Fine, as to ſay, That he who levied the Fine was his Diſſeiſor upon whom he hath before entred, &amp;c.

In this Caſe the Demandant ought to have in his Writ a Forepriſe of the Land, parcel of the Land in demand, whereof the Ioynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancy by Fine is pleaded; for this diſmembring of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and deſtruction of the Land whereof the Ioyntenancy is pleaded, is peravail and beneath the Gift whereof the <hi>Formedon</hi> is conceived; and therefore in reſpect of the title of the Deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, it remains in right parcel of the Manor, and therefore it ought to be demanded accordingly with a Forepriſe: But if <hi>A.</hi> gives to <hi>B</hi> a Manor, except 13 Acres in Tail, there if after upon any Diſcontinuance the Iſſue in Tail is to have a <hi>Formedon,</hi> in ſuch Caſe there needs not any Forepriſe, for the ſaid 10 Acres were never ſevered from the Manor upon the Gift.

And thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Lloyd,</hi> Doctor of Law, appeared and argued to this effect, <hi>viz.</hi> That in ancient times in ſuch caſes, the ſeveral Ordinaries committed ſeveral Adminiſtrations for the Goods in their Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs reſpecive: In which caſe, the miſchief was very great, for the Creditor was driven to bring ſeveral Actions of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrators of the ſeveral Ordinaries: <hi>Vide H.</hi> 7. 13 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrators</hi> 21. But afterwards upon a Decree, upon a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in ſuch caſes, the Metropolitan committed the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration: He further argued, That debts cannot be ſaid <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Notabilia,</hi> for they cannot be ſaid within or without any County or Dioceſs, and are things tranſitory, and therefore called <hi>aes alienum:</hi> And he ſaid, That the Adminiſtration grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Archbiſhop was void, for as Archbiſhop he had not to intermeddle within the Dioceſs of another, but as <hi>Legatus Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pae:</hi> And in the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. <hi>Becket</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was ſtiled <hi>Legatus Natus,</hi> but now that power Legantine is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, and therefore the authority to commit Licences of Adminiſtration in another Dioceſs, but in caſe of <hi>Bona Notabilia</hi> is determined: And he ſaid, That by the Civil Law,<note place="margin">Jones Rep. 225.</note> if a man deviſeth all his Goods in ſuch a County, by that debts do not paſs; and yet by eſpecial words a man may deviſe his debts. <hi>Awbrey</hi> Doctor argued to the contrary; and he confeſſed that in ancient times every Ordinary in ſuch caſes committed licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Adminiſtration: But he denied that the Prerogative which is now practiſed in ſuch caſes by the Metropolitan was given upon any Compoſition, but that it began by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription: If a man in his Iourney dyed in another Dioceſs, notwithſtanding that he had out with him but his neceſſary and ordinary Apparel, in ſuch caſe the Metropolitan committed the Adminiſtration; and he ſaid, That as he conceived, debts are <hi>Bona Notabilia, &amp; ſecundum fictionem Legis,</hi> they are local and he ſaid, to make <hi>Bona Notabilia</hi> it is ſufficient if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtate have 3 <hi>l.</hi> in one Dioceſs, and 2 <hi>l.</hi> in another Dioceſs: But he ſaid, That <hi>poſito,</hi> that <hi>Bona Notabilia</hi> are not in the caſe; yet the Adminiſtration granted by the Metropolitan is not void until it be revoked: For although that the Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:95367:111"/>
on the right of his Biſhoprick, hath not to intermeddle in another Dioceſs; yet in this caſe, becauſe the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> is a Patriarch: (For in Chriſtendom there are four great Patriarchs, and eight leſſer Patriarchs, whereof the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> is one,) and by reaſon thereof, he hath general Iurisdiction through all <hi>England, Ireland, &amp;c.</hi> But now by the Statute, his Authority is reſtrained. For he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not cite any other out of other Dioceſs by any Proceſs: But notwithſtanding, he may do many great Acts by himſelf, or his Chancellor in every Dioceſs; and he argued very much upon the Prerogative of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> The Iuſtices did not then deliver any Opinion in this caſe. <hi>Quaere,</hi> If Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Adminiſtration of the Goods of a common perſon be committed to the Queen, if good.

               <p>THe Caſe was, The King Lord, Meſne and Tenant, the Meſnalty is holden in Chief, and the Tenancy by Service, the Meſnalty Eſcheats by Attainder, now if the Tenancy ſhall be holden in Chief. <hi>Manwood,</hi> It hath been holden, that no Tenure <hi>in Capite</hi> may be, if not by the making of the King: And he ſaid, That if before the Statute of <hi>Weſt.</hi> 3. the Tenant of the King had made a Feoffment to hold of him, ſo that now there is Lord, Meſne, and Tenant, and afterwards the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty comes to the King by Attainder, and if by the ſaid Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty to the Crown, the Seigniory paramount be extinct, then the Tenancy is not holden in Chief; but if the Meſnalty be drowned in the Seignory, it is otherwiſe.

               <p>IN <hi>Ejectione firmae</hi> the Caſe was, That the <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Ely</hi> were ſeized of the Manor of <hi>Sutton,</hi> whereof the place &amp;c. is parcel demiſed and dimiſable by Copy according to the cuſtom: And that the ſaid <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapter</hi> by their Deed granted the Stewardſhip of the ſaid Manor to one <hi>Adams,</hi> to execute the ſaid Office <hi>per ſe vel legitimum ſuum deputat' eis accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabilem:</hi> After which the ſaid <hi>Adams</hi> made a Letter of Deputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to one <hi>Mariot ad Capiend' unam ſurſam redditionem</hi> of one <hi>John Whetteſley</hi> and <hi>Ann</hi> his Wife, <hi>&amp; examinand' Ann' praedict. ea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentione,</hi> That the ſaid <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Ann</hi> ſhould take back an Eſtate thereof for their lives, the Remainder to one <hi>John Buck</hi> in Fee. (Note the Surrender ought to be <hi>de duobus Meſſuagiis) Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot,</hi> Two ſeveral Surrenders of the ſaid Husband and Wife of the ſaid two Meſſuages, and took an Eſtate for their lives, the Remainder over to the ſaid <hi>John Buck</hi> in Fee, upon condition to pay certain Moneys, &amp;c. It was moved, That the Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is void, and without warrant; for the Warrant was <hi>ad Capiend' unam ſurſam redditionem,</hi> and here are two ſeveral Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renders, and ſo the Warrant is not purſued and then the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render is void. Another matter was, becauſe the Remainder to <hi>John Buck</hi> by the words of the Letter of Deputation ſhould be abſolute, and without condition, and now in the Execution of it is conditional, ſo as the conditional Eſtate is not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the Deputation. But the Court was clear of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to the contrary in both the points, That the proceedings here are ſufficient, and well warranted by the Deputation. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother matter was objected, becauſe the Surrender and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant is entred into the Roll of a Court dated to be holden 2 <hi>Maij,</hi> and the Letter of Deputation bears date the 3 of <hi>June</hi> after; but as to that the Court was clear, That the Miſ-entry of the Date of the Court ſhould not prejudice the party, for that Entry is not any matter of Record, but only an Eſcroll; and if the parties had been at Iſſue upon the time of the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render made, or of the Court holden, the ſame ſhould not be tryed by the Rolls of the Manor, but by the Country: And the party ſhall give in Evidence to the truth of the matter, and ſhall not be bound by the Rolls; and according to this Reſolution Iudgment was given.</p>

Long</hi> ſeized of the Manor of <hi>F.</hi> to which the Advowſon was appendant, by his Deed granted the Advow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon unto him 17 <hi>Eliz.</hi> The Incumbent pleaded the ſame Plea; to which the Plaintiff <hi>Replicando</hi> ſaid, That before the ſaid Grant, <hi>viz.</hi> 6 <hi>Eliz.</hi> the ſaid <hi>Tho. Long</hi> granted to him the ſaid Manor, &amp;c. and upon Iſſue joyned, the Iury found this Special Matter, That the ſaid Feoffment was by word, and Livery and Seiſin was made; and afterwards the ſaid <hi>Tho. Long</hi> granted the ſaid Advowſon to the Defendant; and afterwards Attorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was had; and if without Attornment the Advowſon paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the Manor, was the Queſtion. <hi>Shuttleworth</hi> argued, That the Advowſon paſſed as appendant to the Demeſns, for an Advowſon ſhall be more properly appendant to the Demeſns than to the Services, for the Services may be determined ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ways, ſo cannot the Demeſns; for if the Services be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by Eſcheat, &amp;c. yet the Advowſon remains appendant to the Demeſns, and an Advowſon may be appendant to an acre parcel of the Manor, but not to the Services; and ſo an Advow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may well paſs without Deed, as upon a Feoffment of a Manor the Services paſs without Deed. And if a man ſeized of a Manor with an advowſon appendant, makes a Feoffment of one acre parcel thereof, with the advowſon, the advowſon is appendant to that acre, 33 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 5. although it be not by Deed. <hi>Vide contra Temps E.</hi> 1. <hi>Faits &amp; Feoffments</hi> 115. 17 <hi>E</hi> 3. 4. It ought to be by Deed, 43 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 24. <hi>Walmſley</hi> argued to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. The Verdict is, That <hi>Tho. Long</hi> give not the Manor but the Capital Meſſuage of <hi>F.</hi> and all other Lands and Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ſame, which words <hi>(of the ſame)</hi> have relation to the Meſſuage, and therefore neither the Manor of <hi>F.</hi> nor the advowſon paſs: and admit that all the Demeſns paſs, yet the advowſon cannot paſs as appendant, for that advowſon ſhall paſs as appendant to the whole Manor, and not to ſuch, or ſuch part of it. And by <hi>Littleton,</hi> 7 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 27. if a man holds of me three acres by 12 <hi>d.</hi> and I grant the Services of the third acre, the ſame is void; ſo here, there is no advowſon appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant to the Demeſns: And he ſaid, That in this caſe the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowſon is appendant to the Services; and although Services are Inheritances incorporeal, yet an advowſon may be appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant to them, as one Office may be appendant to another Office, and one advowſon to another advowſon, 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Dyer</hi> 48.

Man ſeized of a Manor, to which an Advowſon is appendant, enfeoffeth one by Deed of one acre, parcel thereof; and alſo by the ſame Deed grants the Advowſon the Advowſon ſhall paſs as in groſs, for they are ſeveral Grants although but one Deed. Another matter was, That <hi>Thomas Long</hi> enfeoffed and here the Iury have found, that <hi>Thomas Long</hi> gave in tail, &amp;c. And he conceived that the Plaintiff upon that Verdict ſhould have Iudgment: As in Waſte, the Plaintiff aſſigns the Waſte in cutting down of 20 Oaks, and upon Not Guilty, It was found that he cut down but 10, the Plaintiff ſhall have Iudgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Verdict.

               <p>IN an Action upon the Statute of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> of <hi>Huy</hi> and <hi>Cry,</hi> by <hi>Aſhpool</hi> againſt the Inhabitants of the Hundred of <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringham:</hi> It was argued by Serjeant <hi>Shuttleworth</hi> for the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and he inſiſted upon this, That the Robbery for which the Suit was brought, was committed in the night: and <hi>Vide Stamford</hi> 33 <hi>&amp;</hi> 38. If a man be robbed in the day, and the Chief eſcape, and be not taken, the Town or Hundred ſhall anſwer for it: as if he ſhould have ſaid, If the Robbery was not done in the day, the Town or Hundred ſhould not anſwer for it: and by 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7 5. the Lord cannot diſtrain in the Night for Rent ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rear, for the Tenant is not bound to tender his rent in the night time. And although there are no expreſs words in the Statute of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> that Huy and Cry ſhall be made by the party robbed, yet in reaſon it is to be preſumed that the ſame was intended by the Statute. <hi>Vide</hi> that by theſe words in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute it may be implyed, <hi>viz.</hi> That no pain as yet hath been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for their Concealments and Lacheſs, which (Lacheſs) imports, That none ought to be charged in ſuch caſe, but here there was a defalt, and no defalt can be where there was not notice, and all the courſe is, <hi>Huteſiam &amp; clamorem fecit, &amp; notitiam inhabitantibus dedit;</hi> and alſo this word (Concealment) amounts to as much, for none can be ſaid to conceal that whereof he had no notice. And <hi>vide Stamford</hi> 35, 36. if the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon eſcape the Hundred ſhall anſwer to the party robbed, who hath made Huy and Cry: But the whole Court was clear, that Huy and Cry, or Notice to the Inhabitants, was not requiſite by the Statute; for as it was ſaid by the Lord <hi>Anderſon,</hi> it might be that the party robbed was bound, ſo as he could not give notice, or make Huy and Cry, or it may be he was killed by the Thieves; and <hi>b.</hi> 28 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 11. Freſh ſuit is to be made from Town to Town, and from Country to Country, and that Freſh ſuit is to be made by the Inhabitants of the Hundred, and not by the party robbed, for no mention is made of ſuch Freſh ſuit: And that will more clearly appear, if we take to the Common Law before the Statute of <hi>Wincheſter;</hi> for before the ſaid Statute, the Law was, That every Town and City ſhould be guarded by the Inhabitants, &amp;c. ſo that if any ſuſpected perſons did reſort to ſuch Town or City, he ſhould be ſtayed until the next Seſſions; in which Caſe he ſhould have deliverance according as he could acquit himſelf: And if any Town or City failed therein, and then a Robbery had been done, the County ſhould anſwer for it; for at their

               <head>CCCLXII. Sir <hi>Richard Lewknors</hi> Caſe.</head>
               <p>SIr <hi>Richard Lewknor</hi> ſeized of <hi>Wallingford</hi> Park,<note place="margin">Ante 162.</note> made a leaſe thereof for years, and dyed; the Leſſee granted over his term to another, excepting the Wood; the term expired, and an Action of Waſte was brought againſt the ſecond Leſſee by the Coparceners, and the Husband of the third Coparcener, being Tenant by the Courteſie. <hi>Shuttlewood</hi> and <hi>Snag</hi> Serjeants, did argue, That the Action would not lye in the form it was brought; and the firſt Exception which was taken by them was, becauſe the Action was general, <hi>viz. Quod fecit vaſtum in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, quas Sir Roger Lewknor, pater praedict'</hi> of the Plaintiff <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus haeredes ipſae ſunt praefat' Defendent. demiſit;</hi> And the Count was, that the Reverſion was entailed by Parliament unto the Heirs of the Body of Sir <hi>Richard Lewknor,</hi> and ſo they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the Writ ought to have been ſpecial, <hi>cujus haeredes de Corpore, ipſae ſunt:</hi> For they ſaid, that although there is not any ſuch Writ in the Regiſter, yet in <hi>novo Caſu, novum eſt apponendum remedium:</hi> And therefore they compared the Caſe to the Caſe in <hi>Fitz. N. B.</hi> 57. <hi>viz.</hi> If Land be given to Husband and Wife, and to the Heirs of the Body of the Wife, and the Wife hath Iſſue and dyeth, and the Husband commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth waſte, the Writ in that caſe, and the like, ſhall be ſpecial, and ſhall make ſpecial recital of the Eſtate. And ſo is the Caſe 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 6. where <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> makes a leaſe, and the Leſſee commits waſte; there the Action was brought by the Feof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fees, containing the ſpecial matter, and it was good, although there was not any ſuch Writ in the Regiſter <hi>cujus haeredes de Corpore,</hi> and we are not to deviſe a new form in ſuch caſe, but it is ſufficient to ſhew the ſpecial matter to the Court. And the words of the Writ are true, for they are Heirs to Sir <hi>Roger Lewknor;</hi> and the Count is ſufficient, purſuant and agreeing to their Writ; for they are Heirs, although they
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:95367:118"/>
are not ſpecial Heirs of the Body, and ſo the Court was of Opinion, that the Writ was good notwithſtanding that Exception. And <hi>Anderſon</hi> and <hi>Periam</hi> Iuſtices, ſaid. That the Caſe is not to be compared to the Caſe in <hi>Fitz. Nat. Brevium</hi> 57. for there he cannot ſhew by whoſe demiſe the Tenant hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth if he doth not ſhew the ſpecial Conveyance, <hi>viz</hi> that the Land was given to the Husband and Wife and to the Heirs of the Body of the Wife. Nor is it like to the Caſe of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. for the ſame cauſe. For always the demiſe of the Tenant ought to be ſpecially ſhewed, and certainly which it cannot be in theſe two Caſes, but by the diſcloſing of the title alſo to the rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Another Exception was taken, becauſe that the Writ doth ſuppoſe <hi>Quod tenuerunt,</hi> which, as they conceived, is to be meant, that <hi>tenuerunt</hi> joyntly, whereas in truth they were Tenants in Common. <hi>Walmſley</hi> contrary, becauſe there is not any other form of Writ, for there is not any Writ which doth contain two <hi>tenuerunts</hi> and the words of the Writ are true, <hi>quod tenuerunt,</hi> although <hi>tenuerunt</hi> in Common; but although they were not true, yet becauſe there is no other form of Writ, it is good enough: as <hi>Littleton,</hi> If a Leaſe be made for half a year, and the Leſſee doth Waſte, yet the Writ ſhall ſuppoſe <hi>Quod tenuit ad terminum annorum,</hi> and the Count ſhall be ſpecial: 40 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 41 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 18. If the Leſſee doth commit Waſte and grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth over his term, the Writ ſhall be brought againſt the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and ſhall ſuppoſe, <hi>Quod tenet,</hi> and yet in truth, he doth not hold the Land, and the Writ ſhall not contain two <hi>Tenets,</hi> and ſuch alſo was the Opinion of the Court. The third Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception was, becauſe that the Writ was brought by the two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parceners, and the Heir of the third Coparcener, without na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Tenant by the Courteſie: And thereupon <hi>Snag</hi> cited the Caſe of 4 <hi>E.</hi> 3. That where a Leaſe is made for life, the Remainder for life, and the Tenant for life doth waſte, he in the Reverſion cannot have an Action of Waſte during the life of him in the Remainder: So in the like caſe, the Heir of the third Coparcener cannot have waſte, becauſe there is a mean Eſtate for life in the Tenant by the Courteſie. And to prove that the Tenant by the Courteſie ought to joyn in the Writ, he cited the Caſe of 3 <hi>E.</hi> 3. which he had ſeen in the Book at large, where the Reverſion of a Tenant in Dower was granted to the Husband, and to the Heirs of the Husband, and the Tenant in Dower did waſte, and they did joyn in the Action of Waſte, and holden good: And ſo is 17 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 37. <hi>&amp; F. N. B.</hi> 59. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 25. <hi>Walmſley</hi> contrary; for here in our Caſe, there is nothing to be recovered by the Tenant by the Courteſie, for he cannot recover damages, becauſe the diſinheriſin is not to him, and the term is expired and therefore no place waſted is to be recovered, and therefore it is not like to the Books which have been vouched, For in all thoſe the Tenant was in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:95367:118"/>
and the place waſted was to be recovered, which ought to go to both, according to their Eſtates in Reverſion, but ſo it is not here; for in as much as the term is expired, the Land is in the Tenant by Courteſie, and ſo he hath no cauſe to complain. And ſuch alſo was the Opinion of the whole Court, that the Writ was good notwithſtanding the ſaid Exception. Then concerning the principal matter in Law, which was, whether the Writ was well brought againſt the ſecond Leſſee, or whether it ought to have been brought againſt the firſt Leſſee: It was argued by <hi>Shuttleworth,</hi> That it ought to have been brought againſt the firſt Leſſee; for when he granted over his term, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the Trees, the Exception was good, <hi>ergo, &amp;c.</hi> For when the Land upon which the Trees are growing is leaſed out to another, the Trees paſs with the Leaſe as well as the Land and the profit of them is in the Leſſee during the term, and therefore when he grants his term, he may well except the Trees as well as the Leſſor might have done. And that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Statute of <hi>Marlbridge,</hi> for before that Statute the Leſſee was not puniſhable for cutting down the Trees, and that Statute doth not alter the property of the Trees, but only that the Leſſee ſhould render damages if he cut them down &amp;c. Alſo the words of the Writ of Waſte proveth the ſame, which are, <hi>viz. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n terris, domibus, &amp;c. ſibi dimiſſis.</hi> And the Leſſee might have cut them down for Reparation, and for Firewood, if there were not ſufficient Vnderwood, which he could not have done, if the Trees had not been excepted: And in 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Br.</hi> it is holden, that the excepting of the Trees, is the excepting of the Soil. And ſo is 46 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. where one made a Leaſe excepting the Woods and afterwards the Leſſee did cut them down, and the Leſſor brought an Action of Treſpaſs, <hi>Quare vi &amp; ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis clauſum freg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c.</hi> and it was good, notwithſtanding Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception was taken to it: And it is holden 12 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 8. by <hi>Fairfax &amp; Littleton,</hi> That if the Leſſee cut the Trees that the Leſſor cannot carry them away, but he is put to his Action of Waſte. <hi>Fenner</hi> and <hi>Walmſley</hi> Serjeants contrary: And they conceived that the Leſſee hath but a ſpecial property in the Trees, <hi>viz.</hi> for Fire-boot, Plough-boot, Houſe-boot &amp;c. and if he paſs over the Lands unto another, that he cannot reſerve to himſelf that ſpecial property in the Trees, no more than he who hath Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon appendant, can grant the principal, excepting and reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Common; or grant the Land excepting and reſerving the Common; or grant the Land, excepting the Foldage. The grand property of the Trees doth remain in the Leſſor, and it is proved by 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 30. <hi>&amp;</hi> 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 13. If Tenant for life, and he in the Reverſion joyn in a Leafe, and the Leſſee doth Waſte they ſhall joyn in an Action of Waſte, and the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for life ſhall recover the Free-hold, and the firſt Leſſor the damages, which proves that the property of the Trees is in
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:95367:119"/>
him: As to that, that he was diſpuniſhable at the common Law, that was the folly of the Leſſor; and although it was ſo at the common Law, yet it is otherwiſe at this day; for when the Statute ſays, That the Leſſor ſhall recover damages for the Waſte, that the property of the Trees is in him. As the Statute of <hi>Merton. cap.</hi> 4. enacts, That if the Leſſor do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove part of the Waſte having ſufficient for the Commoners, and they notwithſtanding that bring an Aſſize, they ſhall be barred in that Caſe, and the Lord may have an Action of Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs againſt them if they break the Hedges, by force of that Statute, as it hath been adjudged; for the intent of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute was to ſettle the Inheritance of the Land approved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption of the Commoners, and ſo in this caſe: But note, That by the Statute of <hi>Marlbridge,</hi> the Leſſor ſhall reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver damages for the Houſes, &amp;c. which are waſted &amp;c. and yet a man cannot infer thereupon, that therefore the Leſſee hath no intereſt nor property in them; and ſuch intereſt hath he in the Trees notwithſtanding the words of the Statute, which is contrary to the meaning, as it ſeems; and therefore <hi>Quaere,</hi> if there be any difference betwixt them and what ſhall be meant by this word <hi>(Property.)</hi> But the damages are given by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute in reſpect of the property which the Leſſor is to have in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion after the Leaſe determined. <hi>Anderſon</hi> Chief Iuſtice, The Leſſor hath no greater property in the Trees, than the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner hath in the Soil. <hi>Walmſley</hi> 2 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 2. The Leſſor may give leave to the Leſſee to cut the Trees, and the ſame ſhall be a good Plea in an Action of Waſte, and the reaſon of both the Books is, becauſe the property of them is in the Leſſor. And to this purpoſe the difference is taken in 2 <hi>H.</hi> 7. betwixt Gravel and Trees. 42 <hi>E.</hi> 3. If a Prior licence the Leſſee to cut Trees, the ſame ſhall diſcharge him in a Writ of Waſte brought by the Succeſſor; but if the Leſſee cutteth down the Trees, and then the Prior doth releaſe unto him, the ſame ſhall not bar the Succeſſor, and ſo is 21 <hi>H.</hi> 6. And he ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Culpeppers</hi> Caſe 2 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and 44 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Statham,</hi> and 40 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 22. to prove that the Leſſor ſhall have the Windfalls. If a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger cutteth down Trees, and the Leſſee bringeth an Action of Treſpaſs, he ſhall recover but only to his loſs, <hi>viz.</hi> for lopping and topping. As to that which was ſaid, That if the Leſſee cut down Trees, that the Leſſor cannot take them away, that is true, for that there is a contract of the Law, that if the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee doth cut them down, that he ſhall have the Trees, and the Leſſor have treble damages for them. Alſo he ſaid, That the Trees are no part of the thing demiſed, but are as Servants, and ſhall be for Reparations. As if one hath a Piſcary in the Land of another man, the Land adjoyning is as it were a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, <hi>viz.</hi> to dry the Nets. So if one hath Conduit Pipes lying in the Land of another, he may dig the Land to mend the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:95367:119"/>
Pipes, and yet he hath no Intereſt nor Freehold. To that which was ſaid, That by the excepting of the Trees upon the Land the Land upon which they ſtood is excepted; It is true, as a Servant to the Trees for their nouriſhment, but not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: For if the Leſſor ſelleth the Trees, he afterwards ſhall not meddle with the Land, but it will be wholly in the Leſſor, <hi>quia <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore the Counties here, (if they might) ſhould have joyned in the Tryal: And the Opinion of the Court was againſt the Plaintiff; For <hi>Anderſon</hi> and <hi>Wincham</hi> ſaid, That if this Iſſue could have been tryed by any one of the Counties without the other, it ſhould moſt properly and naturally have been tried in <hi>Middleſex,</hi> where the Oath was made, for the Perjury, if any were was in the <hi>Exchequer:</hi> But they ſaid. The Iſſue here was ill joyned, becauſe it did ariſe upon two points triable in ſeveral Counties, which could not joyn; whereas the Plaintiff might have taken Iſſue upon one of them well enough, for each of them did go to the whole, and if any of them were found for the Plaintiff, that he had ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe to recover. <hi>Gawdy</hi> moved that it ſhould be helped by the Statute of Ieofails, which ſpeaks of miſ-joyning of Iſſues. <hi>Anderſon,</hi> The Iſſue here is not miſ-joyned: For if the Counties could joyn, the Iſſue were good, but becauſe that the Counties cannot joyn, it cannot be well tryed: But the Iſſue it ſelf is well enough. <hi>Windham</hi> and <hi>Rhodes</hi> were of the ſame Opinion; but <hi>Periam</hi> doubted it. <hi>Anderſon</hi> ſaid, That
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:95367:121"/>
if an Iſſue tryable in one Court, be tryed in another and Iudgment given upon it, it is Error. And afterwards <hi>Lutrich</hi> the Attorney ſaid, That it was awarded that they ſhould re-plead; <hi>Nota, quod mirum:</hi> For firſt, the Statute of <hi>32 H. 8. cap. 30.</hi> ſpeaks of miſ-joyning of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and not miſ-joyning of Iſſues; and admit that this Caſe is not within any of thoſe Clauſes, each of them being conſidered by it ſelf, yet I conceive it is contained within the ſubſtance and effect of them, being conſidered together. Alſo I conceive, it is within the meaning of both Statutes, <hi>viz. 32 H. 8. cap. 30. &amp; 18 Eliz. cap. 14.</hi> for I conceive, the meaning of both Statutes was to waſte delays, circuits of Actions and Moleſtations, and that the party might have his Iudgment notwithſtanding any defect, if it were ſo, that notwithſtanding that defect, ſufficient title and cauſe did appear to the Court. And here the Plaintiff hath ſufficient cauſe to recover, if any of the points of the Iſſue be found for him: For if it be found that the matter and ſubſtance of the Oath be found true, which might be tryed well enough by thoſe in <hi>London</hi>) the Plaintiff had cauſe to recover: Wherefore, I conceive that the Verdict in <hi>London</hi> is good enough and effectual: And note, that <hi>Rhodes</hi> ſaid that he was of Counſel in ſuch a caſe in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> betwixt <hi>Nevil</hi> and <hi>Dent.</hi>

               <p>THe caſe was,<note place="margin">8 Co. 55.</note> The late Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> granted to the Earl of <hi>Rutland</hi> the Office of Parkerſhip and Conſtable of &amp;c. <hi>Habendum</hi> from the time of his full age for life, and alſo by the ſame Patent ſhe granted him the Stewardſhip of a Manor, <hi>Habend' praedict' Officia pro termino vitae per Deputatum ſuum vel Deputatos ſuos, &amp;c. eidem Officio pertinent' in tam amplis modo &amp; forma, &amp;c.

If a Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardſhip granted by the King might be exerciſed by a Deputy without ſuch authority given him in his Patent: And he took a Difference between an Office of Truſt and other Offices, as in 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. of a <hi>Carver, &amp;c.</hi> and 11 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 1. the Office of the <hi>Chancellor</hi> of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and ſuch Offices cannot without ſpecial Authority be aſſigned over, 39 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 34.

the Commentaries. Offices of truſt which are inheritances may be executed by Deputy. 8 <hi>Eliz. Dy.</hi> 248. A Steward may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by word; and he ſaid, There is a difference between a Deputy and an Aſſignee; for an Aſſignee can forfeit but his own Eſtate, but a Deputy ſhall forfeit the Eſtate of his Maſter, and therefore if a Steward grant his Office for life who hath the Office in Fee, the Grantee ſhall forfeit no more than his Eſtate for life, 2 <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>Br.</hi> If the under Steward make Admittances, it is good, and yet he is but a Deputy; but if it be out of Court, then it ought to be by a ſpecial Cuſtom, <hi>Vide</hi> 2 <hi>Eliz. Dyer.</hi> The Office of Chyrographer granted for life, and exerciſable by a Deputy: And he ſaid, That in theſe Letters Patents the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſhall be taken beneficially for the Subject, and that for the Honour of the King, if the King be not deceived in his Grant. <hi>Vide</hi> 6 <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>Dyer</hi> 77. <hi>Dodderidge</hi> to the contrary; and he took a difference between Offices of Truſt granted for life, and thoſe which are granted in Fee, for he who hath it but for life cannot aſſign them over; for the Grantor did not intend that another perſon ſhould have the Office, unleſs expreſs mention were made in the Grant of Aſſignees: But when the Office is granted in Fee, there is no ſuch confidence put in the perſon of the Grantee, for his heir ſhall have it, who is a perſon not known to the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. But in all caſes the Grantee is elected for his skill: I agree 10 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 10. he may make a Deputy by ſpecial words, but then that Deputy by thoſe words cannot make a Deputy: That a Steward is an Officer of truſt, is proved; for he enters Plaints in the Court, and Surrenders, and although he hath not a Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Place, yet he hath a Miniſterial Place, and the Lord and Tenants repoſe their truſts in him: And it is alſo an Office of Skill. <hi>Vide</hi> 21 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 20. That the Office of the Keeper of a Park, Steward, &amp;c. cannot be aſſigned without ſpecial words of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignees. And as to the Caſe which was put by <hi>Nicholls,</hi> 8 <hi>Eliz.</hi> That one may make a Steward by word, and therefore an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignee for life by word, it is a <hi>Non ſequitur:</hi> And he ſaid That for another cauſe in the Patent it ſelf, no Deputy in this caſe could be made; for although the words are <hi>Habendum &amp; Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendum, &amp;c. Offic' praedict' per Deputarum ſuum, ſive deputatos ſuos,</hi> the ſame had been good if there had been no <hi>Habendum</hi> before: There was an <hi>Habendum</hi> before in the Patent: But here are three ſeveral <hi>Habendums,</hi> which are as three ſeveral Grants, and the defect of the one ſhall not be ſupplyed by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 22 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 11. 2. Aſſiſes are maintainable for two Offices, although they be by one and the ſelf ſame Grant: And thoſe words <hi>(Volentes, &amp;c.)</hi> in the Patent, are nothing to the purpoſe, for the Grant it ſelf is determinable by the Body of the Grant, and the Clauſe <hi>de Aſſiſtantes</hi> ſhall not ſupply that. <hi>Vide</hi> 20 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 1.

The ſecond Point which <hi>Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deridge</hi> argued was, If there was a ſufficient Diſturbance: and he held that there was not, and therefore the finding of the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry not good: And the Iury hath not found the <hi>vi &amp; armis;</hi> and he ſaid, That when the Writ is <hi>vi &amp; armis,</hi> there ought to be ſome violence, and taking of ſomething, and ſome actual thing is to be done. <hi>Vide F.

another Cuſtom of the ſaid Manor, That if any Tenant for life of the ſaid Manor had a Wife, and dyed, that the Wife ſhall have in the Land her Widows Eſtate: And that after the death of the Wife, that the Son, for a Fine of three years paid to the Lord, ſhould have it for his life, and that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant claimed as Son, according to that Cuſtom. The Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff made Title as Leſſee for years to the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> of the Manor, and traverſeth that there was not any ſuch Cuſtom, that the Son for a Fine of three years paid ſhould have the Land for his life. <hi>Hutton</hi> ſaid, That the Traverſe was good; for if there was not any ſuch Cuſtom, that the Son ſhould have it ſo for life, then <hi>ex conſequente ſequitur,</hi> that there is not any ſuch Cuſtom that the Son ſhould have it after the death of the Wife, or her Surrender, and therefore he needed not to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe the laſt Cuſtom alledged. But the whole Court was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and ruled, That the Traverſe was not good; for he ought to have traverſed the laſt Cuſtom, becauſe there are ſeveral Cuſtoms, and the one is immediately to him, the other not; and the Defendant claimed by the Second Cuſtom, and therefore the Court awarded, That he ſhould amend his Plea.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Hob. Rep. 20. More Rep. 859 2 Brownl. 169.</note>SIr <hi>Henry Rolls</hi> brought a Writ of <hi>Warrantia Chartae</hi> againſt Sir <hi>Robert Osborn</hi> and <hi>Katharine</hi> his Wife, and ſhewed, That the Defendant ought to warrant him a Meſſuage. 40 A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres of Land, 700 Acres of Paſture in <hi>Kelmarſh,</hi> and ſhewed, That Sir <hi>Robert Osborn</hi> and his Wife levied a Fine to him and his Heirs of a Manor, and of the Lands aforeſaid, with warranty to him and his Heirs; and further ſhewed, That a Writ of <hi>Entre ſur diſſeiſin</hi> was brought againſt him of the ſaid Meſſuage, 40 Acres of Land, 700 Acres of Paſture, and that he had demanded the Warranty of the Defendant, or that he would miniſter to him a Plea, which the Defendant hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to do, to his damage of 1000 <hi>l.</hi> the Defendant confeſſed the Fine and Warranty, as aforeſaid; but further pleaded, That in the ſame Term that the Fine was levied, a Writ of Entry was brought againſt Sir <hi>Henry Rolls,</hi> in which Writ he vouched to Warranty the ſaid Defendant, who alone entred into the Warranty and vouched over the common Vouchee, and ſo a Recovery was had accordingly: And averred That the ſaid Recovery was to the uſe of Sir <hi>Henry Rolls</hi> for his life, and if there was a Marriage between him and <hi>A. S.</hi> within 4 years, then to the uſe of the ſaid <hi>A. S.</hi> for her Ioynture, with divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:95367:130"/>
over and averred the life of Sir <hi>H. Rolls:</hi> Vpon which the Plaintiff did demur in Law. <hi>Shirley</hi> Serjeant argued for the Plaintiff. That the Warranty was not deſtroyed, but that the Plaintiff might well mantain his <hi>Warrantia Chartae:</hi> and for the ſame he vouched 22 <hi>H.</hi> 6.22. <hi>Cliffords Caſe;</hi> That there ought to be an alteration of the Eſtate to which the Warranty is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, and here is no alteration of the Eſtate; for although the Recovery was had the ſaid Term and a Voucher upon it, yet becauſe the uſes did not take effect preſently, but were contingent uſes, he remained Tenant in Fee-ſimple as he was before; and ſo the firſt Warranty remained, and was not deſtroyed. <hi>Mountague</hi> Serjeant contrary; and that the <hi>Warrantia Chartae</hi> was gone, and that for four Cauſes: 1. He who comes to an Eſtate in the <hi>Poſt</hi> ſhall not have a <hi>Warrantia Chartae,</hi> but Sir <hi>Hen. Rolls</hi> cometh to the Eſtate in the <hi>Poſt, ergo,</hi> he ſhall not have <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantia Chartae.</hi> And for that <hi>vide</hi> 29 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 34. Lord by Eſcheat ſhall not have <hi>Warrantia Chartae.</hi> 22 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 57. The Lord of a Villain ſhall not have a <hi>Warrantia Chartae.</hi> 21 <hi>H.</hi> 6. Diſſeiſor ſhall not have <hi>Warrantia Chartae:</hi> and ſo 19 <hi>H</hi> 6.25. 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7.10. Tenant by the Courteſie ſhall not have the Writ, becauſe all theſe come to the Lands in the <hi>Poſt:</hi> But ſee <hi>Cook</hi> 3. <hi>part, Lincoln Colledge Caſe,</hi> they may have peradventure benefit of a Rent or of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but not of a Warranty, 27 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>garr' Statham acc'.</hi> 2. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Warranty ought to have the ſame Eſtate continuing to which the Warranty is annexed, but Sir <hi>Hen. Rolls</hi> had not the ſame Eſtate continuing, <hi>ergo,</hi> he ſhall not have the Warranty, becauſe the Fine was to him and his Heirs with Warranty; but this Recovery (which was but a further aſſurance) was but to the uſe of himſelf for life, with divers Remainders over ſo as the firſt Eſtate is altered: And 42 <hi>E.</hi> 3.2. 40 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 14. it is a good Plea in a <hi>Warrantia Chartae,</hi> that the Demandant is not Tenant. And 41 <hi>Eliz. in Bointon &amp; Cheſters Caſe,</hi> it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged in this Court, That if a man makes a Feoffment with Warranty, who enfeoffs the firſt Feoffor, upon Condition that that Warranty remains, he ſhall vouch by reaſon of the firſt Warranty; but if upon that Feoffment he had limited any new uſe, there becauſe the Eſtate was altered, the Voucher was gone. <hi>Vide F. N. B.</hi> 135. 19 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>T. Voucher</hi> 12.2. 48 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>acc'.</hi> And it was Reſolved 34 <hi>Eliz in Banco Regis in Kempe &amp; Henninghams Caſe,</hi> That in ſuch Caſe he ſhould not have ſeveral <hi>Warrantia Charta's:</hi> And therefore becauſe in the principal Caſe he hath once vouched upon this Recovery, and upon that the Eſtate is altered, he cannot now have <hi>Warrantia Chartae.</hi> 3. Every Warranty is a Covenant real, which conſiſts in privity, and therefore deſtroy the privity, and the warranty is gone. But now in this Caſe the firſt privity is deſtroyed, therefore the warranty is gone. And therefore 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 8. if two Ioyntenants be with warranty, and one of them maketh a Feoffment in Fee,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:95367:131"/>
the warranty is deſtroyed, becauſe the firſt privity is deſtroyed, 21 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 51. <hi>acc'.</hi> But <hi>Vide</hi> 19 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Statham Garr'</hi> 31. If two Ioyntenants are with warranty, and the one Releaſes to the Feoffor, there the warranty remains, becauſe the privity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, <hi>Vide</hi> 2 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 7. <hi>Cook</hi> 1 <hi>Part, Chudleighs Caſe</hi> 125. <hi>acc'.</hi> And ſee <hi>M.</hi> 31 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in this Court, <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Watts</hi> Caſe: Land is given to Husband and Wife, and to the Heirs of the Body of the Husband and Wife, the Husband levies a Fine, and dyes without Iſſue, the Wife is impleaded, and adjudged that ſhe could not have Aid, nor <hi>Warrantia Chartae,</hi> becauſe the Eſtate was bound by the Fine, the Husband being Tenant in ſpecial Tail. 4. No warranty can have but one recompence, and if there be recompence given, the warranty is gone and extinct: But here is a recompence made by the Voucher in this Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, therefore the warranty is extinct. 34 <hi>Aſſ. pl.</hi> 15. 23 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>garr'</hi> 77. <hi>acc'.</hi> and 15 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 13. 12 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 12. If he will not take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the warranty when he may, he ſhall never have it after. <hi>Vide F. N. B.</hi> 134. <hi>acc':</hi> And 36 <hi>Eliz.</hi> it was adjudged in <hi>Owens</hi> Caſe, That if Tenant in Tail bargains and ſells his Lands, and ſuffers a Recovery, and afterwards Inrolls the Deed, that that Recovery is a good bar to the Eſtate tail, becauſe there is a ſuppoſition of recompence: and ſo he prayed Iudgment for the Defendants. It was adjourned. <hi>Vide</hi> this Caſe now Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in the Lord <hi>Hoberts</hi> Reports.</p>
